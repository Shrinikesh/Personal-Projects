An upbeat attitude is critical to making progress in anything you undertake. Find the answers you seek in conversations with others.,12,aries,2017
26,You're in the process of changing directions in your professional life. This can't be done in a day. It's sometimes painful. Things will be going slowly and require you to think and confront yourself honestly. Don't run away even if you're tempted to do so. Trust that you aren't far from your goal.,12,aries,2017
27,"The mood is oppressive and heavy today. Some disappointments will crop up here and there if you have to prove yourself in any way, either privately or professionally. There is some likelihood you'll feel angry with someone important to you. Don't yield to your negative feelings too quickly. It would be bad for your morale.",12,aries,2017
28,"You're having a difficult time connecting with your emotions today. Things will run more smoothly if you don't try to force yourself to act cheerful if you aren't. Be honest about your emotions. If you're feeling restless or negative, keep it to yourself. Go for a walk, preferably near water, and indulge in a good healthy meal.",12,aries,2017
29,"Have you been thinking about remodeling or redecorating your home? If so, this is the day to do it. Your energy and aesthetic sense are high today. Enlist the aid of family members in planning colors, styles, and arrangements. A lot of activity may go on in and around your home, and you'll be enthusiastic. Make sure on one works to the point of exhaustion.",12,aries,2017
30,"Today is a great day for you in which you should enjoy a great deal of playful conversation with others, Aries. Fantasy is likely to play a large role in the events of the day, and you may find yourself daydreaming as you walk down the street. Don't bother with reality today if you don't have to. You're much better off keeping the tone light and playful. Enjoy your fantasy world and feel free to invite others into it.",12,aries,2017
31,"You may have your ups and downs today, Aries. You could get at least one phone call of the ""good news, bad news"" variety, and this could have your moods swinging back and forth like a pendulum. Try to stay centered. Take the good news as encouragement, and as for the bad news, try to consider it objectively and figure out ways to turn it to your advantage. There's always a way. Hang in there!",12,aries,2017
1,"This is a great day to start any project that concerns writing, acting, or speaking, Aries. Your creative energies should be flowing freely and abundantly today, and you should enjoy the rush of new ideas that keep popping into your head. A number of stimulating conversations with close friends should keep your energies churning. Expect to spend a lot of time on the phone, or perhaps in the car dropping in on these friends. Enjoy your day!",1,aries,2018
2,"Don't take anything at face value today, Aries, especially if it involves money. It's likely that a friend or colleague will approach you with a deal that is too good to pass up. Don't let yourself get caught up in the promise of quick riches. Any deal that is presented as ""too good to be true"" usually is. Take in the information and review it at a later time. You will find that flaws are revealed once cooler heads prevail.",1,aries,2018
3,"You may find yourself thinking of looking for a new job in order to increase your income, Aries. But there is probably no need to take such a drastic step. It's possible that your boss has been considering giving you a raise - you may soon be pleasantly surprised. If your money concerns are only short-term, consider asking a family member for a loan at a low interest rate. Once you're back on your feet, you'll be able to pay it off in no time.",1,aries,2018
4,"While you may feel the urge to put on a pair of boxing gloves and duke it out with your family, Aries, try putting on an oven mitt instead. Cooking a meal or performing other domestic chores will help take your mind off your troubles with your family. If you aren't the domestic sort, exchange the mitt for some reading glasses and bury yourself in your work. These tensions on the home front will pass quickly enough.",1,aries,2018
5,"Someone close to you might not be feeling very well, Aries, and you might feel the need to remain nearby and take care of this person. By all means do this. However, bear in mind that your empathic abilities are operating at a very high level today, and therefore you could actually experience some of their discomfort. Be sure to protect yourself psychically by keeping the white light around you if you want to avoid feeling ill yourself.",1,aries,2018
6,"You're apt to be in a very joyous mood today, Aries, and it's going to show on your face. This isn't going to go unnoticed by the people you meet. You could make some new friends, and, if you aren't currently romantically involved, you might actually meet an interesting potential love partner. This person is apt to be very polite and polished, not to mention smart! Be cordial, be nice, and enjoy your day.",1,aries,2018
7,"It's another potentially anxious day ahead, Aries. But you have the power to soothe your ruffled feathers. Physical activity of any sort will calm you down considerably. Even a quick walk around the block will be of benefit. A calmer disposition in the afternoon makes it easier for you to handle favors and requests with your customary grace. If you need to, you can ""disappear"" for a few hours early in the afternoon and take in a movie.",1,aries,2018
8,"Gloom over the absence of a family member or romantic partner could come upon you today, Aries, and your usually exuberant nature could be far more subdued than is normal for you. You might even spend the entire evening watching whatever happens to be on TV. It would be far more productive if you treated yourself to a trip to the bookstore and picked up some new reading material. At least you'll learn something while your partner is away!",1,aries,2018
9,"Once begun is half done, as the saying goes. This certainly applies to you today, Aries. Yes, it's true that you have a considerable amount of work ahead of you, but surely you know that you can get it done. Trite as it may sound, making a list (no, you don't have to check it twice) will help you break the projects down into manageable chunks. It's so much easier to focus only on the next step rather than the entire Herculean task.",1,aries,2018
10,"A close friend or love partner may not be returning your calls, Aries, and your insecurities could well get the best of you, causing you to think your friend doesn't care anymore. Don't fall into this trap. Your friend is probably surrounded by a lot of demanding people who need assistance, and therefore isn't phoning anybody else. Be patient, distract yourself, and give your friend another call tomorrow. The response should be more immediate then!",1,aries,2018
11,"The opportunity to take a trip by air, perhaps at someone else's expense, could come to you today, Aries. This might be business related or it could be educational in some way. This is a good day to travel or make the arrangements for it. The journey promises to be an exciting one that you'll remember for a long time. Do what you have to in order to get it all together and then go for it! Enjoy your day.",1,aries,2018
12,"This is a good day for meditation or spiritual studies of some kind, Aries. Your intuition should be operating at a very high level and thus it's going to be easier for you to tune in to the thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires of others, particularly the opposite sex. You might even experience psychic insights or visions that shed light on some questions you've been asking yourself for a while. Write down your thoughts. You'll want to remember them.",1,aries,2018
13,"Perhaps it's best if you stay away from your current love partner today, Aries. Your friend is having some very draining hassles with family and on the job and won't be in the best of moods. If the two of you get together, you might find your partner in a surly and uncommunicative mood, and you might be the recipient of some unkind words. Either be prepared to deal with it or do something else tonight.",1,aries,2018
14,"Your mind always tends to be quick and agile, Aries, but today you might find it going a thousand miles an hour as a result of intriguing new information received through books, newspapers, television, or the Internet. Discussions with others could also contribute. You might decide to embrace some innovative new concepts that could lead to an expansion of your horizons. At some point, go for a workout. You need to balance the mental with the physical.",1,aries,2018
15,"Group activities and social events excite your passions today, Aries. You'll meet lots of new people, take on some interesting new projects, and, if you haven't already, you might even fall in love. A number of fascinating ideas exchanged at these events might propel you into a new course of study. Partnerships of any kind formed today stand a powerful chance of succeeding. In the evening, go to dinner with your new friends.",1,aries,2018
16,"Unexpected premonitions and gut feelings might prove too strong for comfort, Aries, especially if they sense upcoming events that aren't all that pleasant. These feelings are sent to you not to worry you or cause upset but to give clues as to how to deal with the possibilities. You may also have to deal with your own self-doubt. Dig in, do what you can, and assure a positive outcome. Remember, it's possible to spin straw into gold!",1,aries,2018
17,"Generally you tend to let paperwork go, Aries, but today the necessity of handling budgeting and financial matters could force you to sit down and get it all done. However, where money and other resources are concerned, you're apt to be especially practical and efficient, so don't be surprised if you sail right through it and get it done well. Other paperwork, such as your own writing, should go equally well. Afterward, treat yourself to a nice dinner in your favorite restaurant!",1,aries,2018
18,"An intense conversation with a close friend or romantic partner could bring you closer to this person. You probably share a number of goals, Aries, and discussions could lead to how you could work together in order to make them happen for both of you. You're more likely to take the lead, however, since your communicative abilities are particularly high right now. Put your heads together and move forward! Enjoy!",1,aries,2018
19,"You may be a specialist at manipulating concepts and ideas and using your analytical skills to understand any problem that comes your way. If this is true, Aries, people have probably already told you that thinking is fine, but there is a moment when you have to put all that thinking into practice! The position of the planets today invites you to think about this.",1,aries,2018
20,"You may have been worrying about something you did recently that you aren't very proud of. Today you'll discover that all that worrying was for nothing. The reality you've been trying to run away from lately will be right before your eyes and you'll see that it isn't so bad after all. You'll be rewarded for all your hard work, as if life were trying to give you a lesson about being optimistic. So don't be so negative!",1,aries,2018
21,"Some boring paperwork regarding money, which you may have been putting off, might need to be executed today. Bills may need to be paid, deposits put in the bank, and new accounts opened. You could spend some time formulating new plans for the future. This probably will take up a lot of your time, Aries, but there will still be enough for you to go shopping and make a few necessary purchases. Friends might accompany you. Enjoy!",1,aries,2018
22,"If you've been thinking about starting a garden, this is a great day to do it, since anything relating to the land you begin today is likely to thrive. Doubts about your financial security might be on your mind, Aries. They're probably misplaced, because you should continue to do well. However, your doubts can serve a purpose in that they could inspire you to take steps to ensure that your situation continues. Go to it!",1,aries,2018
23,"Some rather intense and vivid dreams could inspire you to embark on some in-depth study of a subject that specifically interests you, Aries. This could involve the arts, philosophy, or metaphysics. Travel plans to one of the world's great spiritual centers, such as Jerusalem, Glastonbury or Vrindavana, might be on your mind as a result. Your level of intuition is very high today, so whatever you dream of doing, give it some serious thought. It might be just what you need!",1,aries,2018
24,"Don't fritter away your time with a person who isn't going to change his or her mind about something, Aries. This is one of those days in which you may end up wasting your time and everyone else's by continuing to insist that things be done a certain way. If you want to do something your way, then do it. If someone else wants to do something his or her way, then let that person do it.",1,aries,2018
25,"A delivery of some kind that you were expecting to come from far away might be delayed, causing you to wonder if it might have been lost. It hasn't, Aries; it's just delayed. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do but wait. Equipment you use on the job could go out of whack today, necessitating calling in a repairman. This could set your work back some and make you a bit antsy. Try to find something else to do!",1,aries,2018
26,"Thoughts of travel could be on your mind today, Aries, and you might tinker with the idea of actually taking time off and going somewhere that you've always wanted to visit. A friend or love partner might want to accompany you. The only problem might be figuring out what place you want to see the most. This could involve a rather difficult decision. Don't let it become obsessive. Follow your heart.",1,aries,2018
27,"You're likely to hit that magic spot with someone today in which you can almost read each other's thoughts, Aries. You may know exactly what that person is going to say before he or she says it. You may also find that your mind is working so quickly that while someone is trying to make one point, you are already five steps ahead of where that person is trying to go. Put your gifts to good use.",1,aries,2018
28,"An increased level of irritability and frustration could tempt you to take it out on friends, children, or your significant other. You're probably feeling especially energetic, with little if any outlet for that energy, Aries. On days like this you might want to consider jogging, going to the gym, or taking an aerobics class. This can both provide an outlet and produce some endorphins that override the stress and strain. Go to it!",1,aries,2018
29,"Your imagination is in all likelihood drawing you to faraway places, Aries, and you may find yourself daydreaming constantly. At times, these dreams may seem to get in the way of your usual rational, linear way of dealing with everyday life. Remember that these dreams have been sent to you for a reason and that you should try to comprehend and consciously integrate their messages into your everyday waking life.",1,aries,2018
30,"A social event could bring a fascinating new someone, perhaps from a different culture, into your life, Aries. This person could end up talking to you for hours about a number of intriguing subjects that interest you both. You could meet some other interesting people as well, and some could become friends, but this person could well end up as a very close friend or romantic partner. Make sure you exchange phone numbers. Have fun!",1,aries,2018
31,"A social event or group rally could put you in touch with some new and exciting people in interesting fields, Aries. You might even run into an old friend you haven't seen for a long time. If you aren't currently romantically involved, an attractive new person could come on the scene. This promises to be an exciting and stimulating day for you. Don't be surprised if new doors to a great future open for you. Enjoy!",1,aries,2018
1,"Your heart is apt to beat much more rapidly than usual, Aries. Love is in the air, the trees, and the people around you. Whatever you do today, make sure that you spend the evening with someone special. Love is apt to be very expansive for you. Just the smallest seed will blossom into a gorgeous flower right before your eyes. Experience the full-body sensation of being immersed in love with the world around you.",2,aries,2018
2,"Go for the gusto today, Aries. Nothing can stop you. You’ve got a tremendous amount of power at your disposal, so use it wisely. You can accomplish a great deal and make extremely positive transformations in your life. Your physical vitality is especially strong and your sex life may be especially active. Make sure to share with others the enthusiasm you exude. You aren’t the only person alive on this planet, so spread some of that love around.",2,aries,2018
3,"A picture of an art object from a different culture could arouse some strange feelings in you, Aries. You won't know why, but it will spark a new interest in that culture. This probably relates to events deep in your past that you don't remember. Go ahead and explore this new interest. It will be intriguing and at the same time could help you release old traumas or phobias. Enjoy!",2,aries,2018
4,"Dare to be different, Aries. It can be so easy to fall into a drill. Sleeping at the same time, eating at the same time, wearing the same style, and going about work the same way day after day. Before you know it, you feel like you're in a rut. The only way to get away from this is to make a decision to break free by doing something unique. Try a new haircut. Wear colors that are unusual for you. If the need is there, consider a new career. Pursue expansion.",2,aries,2018
5,"The effect from the planetary aspects will bring an end to any lethargy you've been feeling, Aries. It's an excellent day to get up and head into the open to do something active. Walking, running, or going on a hike can make great use of both your energy and creativity. Fresh air and physical exertion will lend much to your health as well, so make the most of this. Even if you have to work today, you can always enjoy the evening.",2,aries,2018
6,"You might discover that someone close to you, a family member perhaps, could use a hand today, Aries. Chances are good, too, that he or she won't ask for help out of pride. Don't let that stop you, though. If you recognize a situation where you can be of assistance, go for it. Don't wait for an invitation or request. Simply take hold of the circumstances and do what you can. Your efforts will be appreciated and you'll leave feeling terrific that you could make a difference.",2,aries,2018
7,"Today you might want to talk over any plans you have or would like to make with those you live with, Aries. If you live alone, there isn't much chance that your plans will affect anyone, but for those of you cohabiting with others, take time to extend this courtesy. It might be that someone else in the house had some intentions that you weren't aware of, or there may be someone in need of something from you. Talk things over and everything will work out just fine.",2,aries,2018
8,"Take the time to consider your physical and mental health today, Aries. Given your hard-driving nature, these are areas that may be neglected. One really affects the other. If you overwork your brain or put off dealing with problems, your physical health will suffer. Things like excess weight, addiction, and bouts of depression are all indicators that there is an imbalance in your life. See about getting things more in sync.",2,aries,2018
9,"See about getting as active as possible today, Aries. This could really give your overall health a boost, especially if you've been sedentary lately. Try something fun like engaging in sports or taking a pooch for a walk. Gardening and cutting the lawn are other activities that are better for you than sitting all day. The physical movement can reduce stress and give you a sense of accomplishment. Every part of you benefits from being active. Check it out.",2,aries,2018
10,"Today you're likely to complete a creative project of some kind that you’ve been working on for some time, Aries. You might want to consult with friends or colleagues, get their feedback on what you're doing, and listen to their advice. They may point out both strong and weak points of which you were previously unaware, and this should definitely prove valuable to you. The results you achieve could surprise even you. Go for it!",2,aries,2018
11,"Today you're likely to be longing for a little break from your daily routine, Aries, and for an evening alone with a love partner. You're feeling sensual and passionate, but you also have much to report concerning new opportunities that have recently come up. Some of these, if implemented, could well change your life in a profound way. You'll want your partner's opinion, since it concerns him or her as well. Choose your words carefully and get the enthusiasm going!",2,aries,2018
12,"Paperwork involving money might seem a bit overwhelming today, Aries, and you might ask a friend for advice or assistance. This person probably knows what it's all about, so listen even though you might not understand much of what he or she says! Financial benefits could be in the wind. You may be entertaining outrageous fantasies of what you're going to buy with it all. Dream all you want, but be practical when the windfall comes!",2,aries,2018
13,"There is a rough stubbornness to the day that you may find hinders your progress, Aries. There may be undercurrents of opposition that are slowly wearing away at your psyche. Make sure that you don't fall into the trap of feeling guilt or regret. These are useless emotions that you simply can do without. If people are being negative or unreasonable, simply walk away from the situation and find a better one.",2,aries,2018
14,"Get-togethers with friends today could prove a bit unsettling, Aries, as someone who attends them could throw out an opinion or possibility that seems rather shocking. This opinion, however, is likely to be based on rumor, gossip, and other misinformation, so it would be a good idea to suggest that these concepts be explored in order to ascertain the facts. They'll probably turn out to be far more positive than you hear today.",2,aries,2018
15,"This should be a very busy day for you, Aries, as communications involving business matters could take up much of your time. These could concern your own goals or those of a friend or a group with which you're affiliated. Whatever it is, you should feel a strong sense of elation and optimism. Success is definitely in the wind. However, try not to exhaust yourself. Take occasional breaks. Don't forget that you'll need to keep going tomorrow.",2,aries,2018
16,"Your home might need some work today, Aries. You and other members of your household could decide to join forces and get everything done. This might simply involve a thorough cleaning, or it could mean major repairs of some sort, perhaps plumbing or electrical. If the latter, it isn't a good idea to try to do this yourself. There could be factors involved that are more complicated than they seem. Don't be afraid to call in a professional.",2,aries,2018
17,"Today, Aries, you might find yourself getting more irritated than you usually would at the quirks of friends, colleagues, partners, and children. Nerves could be frayed and tempers around you frazzled. At times like this it's best to remain centered and make the effort to be your usual warm and friendly self. No lasting rifts are likely to result, but tension with others can make for an uncomfortable day.",2,aries,2018
18,"You can count on a very idyllic and romantic day today, Aries. You’re feeling especially warm and sensual, and you tend to view the partner in your life through rose-colored glasses. He or she is very likely to regard you in the same way. If you've been longing for a dinner for two, complete with champagne, candlelight, and red roses, this is the day to go for it. And don't forget the violin music!",2,aries,2018
19,"Uneasy feelings may be plaguing you throughout the day, Aries. There could appear to be no valid reason for this. Everything seems to be going well for you, and no one close to you has anything heavy going on. It's probably nothing Earthshaking. You may just be intuitively picking up on the troubles and anxieties of people you pass on the street. Your intuition is high today, so you could psychically sense just about anything. Hang in there!",2,aries,2018
20,"Sex and romance are very much on your mind today, Aries. You’re feeling especially passionate, and your emotions are rich and deep. At times like this you’re likely to want to concentrate on your own pleasure, yet it’s important to be sensitive to your partner as well. Racy novels and movies could be especially appealing, and you might toy with the idea of shopping at Victoria's Secret. Go for it!",2,aries,2018
21,"Career matters could move so slowly today that you just might be tempted to give up, Aries. Don't even think that way! It's just one of those days when nothing seems to go right, even though basically everything should still be going very well for you. Don't expect much progress today, and certainly don't expect anything but gloom from colleagues. Put a calendar with cartoons on the wall so you can distract yourself with some laughs throughout the day.",2,aries,2018
22,"No sooner do you set foot in the office this morning than you begin to get pelted from all directions with various crises and problems, Aries. It isn’t a very welcome reception. A hot cup of coffee and a warm greeting from your co-workers would be a much nicer way to start the day. Take it all in stride. You have the brainpower and stamina to solve all the day's problems.",2,aries,2018
23,"A change of scene is in store for you, Aries. It’s unclear whether or not this is a voluntary move, but it’s clear that chaos and confusion reign over the next few days. There is much to be done. Fortunately, your organizational abilities will serve you well. You don your general's hat, wield your clipboard like a sword, and get everybody doing your bidding. The move is completed in record time!",2,aries,2018
24,"Today you might find yourself compelled to stay at home for some reason, Aries. Perhaps you're expecting a visitor who's late or a delivery of some kind. Therefore, you could feel somewhat antsy. You like staying home, but only if you choose to do so. Find something creative to fill the time you have to spend waiting. That might make you feel as if you're choosing even if you aren't.",2,aries,2018
25,"Your creative nature will no longer be repressed, Aries! As you look around your home, you realize you feel the need to spruce it up a bit. Motivated by a desire to give dinner parties and invite family members who live far away to come for a visit, you get to work repainting, wallpapering, and maybe even sending that sofa out to be reupholstered. The final result will be fantastic, Aries. You’ll be proud.",2,aries,2018
26,"Be sure to open your mail and answer the phone today, Aries, as you’re likely to receive some interesting information from a friend or business associate. It could be that a deal that's been in the works has just been signed, or a romantic interest you've been pursuing finally returns your affections. Whatever the day brings, it’s likely to be favorable.",2,aries,2018
27,"Misinformation is likely to spread like wildfire today, causing a lot of unnecessary upset either among your neighbors at home or your colleagues at work. Don't accept at face value any gossip or rumor you hear, Aries. Check the accuracy of the information yourself. If it does turn out to be false, as is likely, you'll feel sorry if you've had any part in perpetuating it.",2,aries,2018
28,"A rebirth of romance in your life could take place today, Aries. If you're currently involved with someone, a happy event could enrich the bond between you and bring you closer together. If you aren't presently attached, you could be by the end of the day. You might meet someone new and exciting, probably an intelligent person who could be involved with modern technology. Make sure you look your best, and expect the unexpected!",2,aries,2018
1,"You probably aren't feeling your best today, Aries. No doubt your illness is a result of recent overindulgence. You can't blame anyone but yourself for your crashing headache and queasy stomach. Try not to take your bad mood out on the family. Just ask them to close the curtains and shut the door. You will emerge in the early afternoon feeling a bit wobbly but definitely on the mend.",3,aries,2018
2,"Be prepared today, Aries. A longtime dream regarding your career may finally become a reality. At first you might not believe it, fighting the news in order to avoid possible disappointment. Don't fall into this trap; it creates negative energy, which can get in your way. You've worked hard to be where you are, and you aren't likely to stop advancing. Accept your accolades, thank everyone, and then move on.",3,aries,2018
3,"Your physical vitality is extra strong today, Aries, although your thoughts may be a little clouded. Someone could strongly object to an action of yours, but realize that their motivation may be a bit skewed. Muster the self-confidence to stand up for yourself at this time. Whatever happens, you'll be called on to take action one way or another. Take the time to assess the facts carefully, because there may be trickery going on.",3,aries,2018
4,"Plans for getting together with friends or a romantic partner might have to be postponed because of professional responsibilities that need attention. This could prove upsetting, Aries, especially since you have to disappoint others, but these things happen. Don't let it get to you. This will have no lasting effect on any of your relationships. Work hard, get it done, and schedule time for some fun a bit later.",3,aries,2018
5,"Sudden changes in your romantic situation could occur today, Aries. If you're currently committed to someone, expect some surprising propositions from your partner. If you're involved but not committed, a marriage proposal might be in the picture. If you aren't currently involved, you could meet someone new and exciting under unusual circumstances. Make sure you look your best today, even if you're only running down to the supermarket!",3,aries,2018
6,"Take your leadership abilities to a new level, Aries. Gather some friends and plan a trip that you've long been considering but were reluctant to act on. People will naturally look to you for leadership and guidance, as you always seem to know how to keep things fun and positive. When it comes to your workplace, this might be a good time to ask for more responsibility - and a raise.",3,aries,2018
7,"A selfish attitude on your part won't be tolerated today, regardless of the circumstances, Aries. Don't make it worse for yourself by pretending that you don't notice others' hurt feelings. People are likely to be extra sensitive today, so be careful about trying to impose your will on someone who really wants nothing more than an ear to talk to and a shoulder to cry on.",3,aries,2018
8,"The more you can apply to your own life the advice you give to others, the better off you'll be, Aries. No one is going to follow a leader who doesn't abide by his or her own standards. If you're going to offer your guidance to someone else, make sure you're willing to operate by the same rules and accept feedback regarding their effectiveness.",3,aries,2018
9,"You're in a romantic mood today, Aries. You're more likely to notice attractive strangers you pass on the street, and attract admiring glances from them! Racy novels and movies could seem more appealing than usual, and you might do some window-shopping for sensual products. This is definitely an evening to spend with that special person in your life. Have a professional style your hair to make sure you look your best!",3,aries,2018
10,"You're being called upon to take action in many areas today, Aries. People may be tugging at you to be with them and participate in their world of fun and excitement. It could also be that there are many projects that catch your attention today, and you're conflicted about which ones to put your energy into. Friction may arise as you find yourself tearing away from one situation to participate in another.",3,aries,2018
11,"There is a tremendous amount of physical energy building within you, Aries. Be careful that you don't let this incredible force come out in the form of a heated argument against someone you really care about. Perhaps you suddenly feel as if everything is caving in and you desperately need some means of escape. Go for a good long run. Find a way to release this tension.",3,aries,2018
12,"The key word for you today is boundaries, Aries, so think for a minute about what this means to you. It's time to have a serious talk with yourself.

13,"Your energy will light up any room you enter today, Aries. Feel free to take advantage of this incredible magnetism by initiating and encouraging others to join you in creative activities and bold adventures.

Everything should be much calmer tomorrow.",3,aries,2018
16,"Communication problems might arise on the job. Perhaps a co-worker is in a bad mood and unreceptive to anything you say. Or perhaps the phones are out or the computers down. This could prove frustrating, Aries, and might interfere with relations among staff members. A phone call from a close friend or lover could go astray but reach you at the last minute. Don't worry; you'll still have a great evening!",3,aries,2018
17,"In an effort to be the brightest and best star on the stage, Aries, you might actually be driving away the most important members of your audience. Make sure that you aren't putting on different masks with different people just so you can appease those you're with. Others can see right through any disguise you try to put on. Trying to deceive others is simply a sign of disrespect.",3,aries,2018
18,"Paperwork regarding finances, possibly those connected with your job, might take up a lot of your time today, Aries.

Advancement through your own efforts is strongly indicated by the aspects in force today.",3,aries,2018
19,"You may feel as if people have turned against you today and that they've suddenly lost interest in what you have to say, Aries. Maybe this is a reflection of your own inability to truly listen to someone else talking. Look at the collective picture and open your eyes to the world around you. Get involved in the community instead of only focusing on you all the time.",3,aries,2018
20,"The planetary energy has you feeling a bit sluggish today. You'll probably want to stay home, surrounded by your books, pets, and plants, yet you know you have appointments to keep and responsibilities to fulfill. Your sense of duty is especially strong. Make a deal with yourself to get the bare minimum done and then relax. Try a hot bath and listening to classical music.",3,aries,2018
21,"A number of invitations to social events could come your way today, some from people you really don't know well. Don't pass them up, however. You could make some fortunate contacts or even some new friends at these parties. You enjoy being around people, Aries, but today you might find it a bit tedious. Your heart is with your family.

22,"You're a gregarious person by nature, Aries, and today you might want to socialize and enjoy yourself.

23,"Your innate charm and good manners have brought you good relationships with both co-workers and superiors, and today you might find that this has served you well, Aries.

Jot down your ideas and look at them again tomorrow. If you want to continue, then go for it!",3,aries,2018
25,"Delays and frustrations could plague you throughout the day, Aries, especially regarding communications. A young visitor you're expecting at your home today could be delayed in some way and might not be able to call and let you know. Don't waste any time worrying.

Remember that you're both human! Enjoy your day.",3,aries,2018
27,"Expect today's planetary energies to raise your social consciousness, Aries. You may be distracted with thoughts of the homeless person you saw today, or the television special you saw on babies with AIDS.

Be attentive, and enjoy your evening.",3,aries,2018

New discoveries regarding the benefits of certain nutrients, exercise programs, or other forms of alternative therapy could attract your attention.

Social events could find you and your beloved among both old and new friends, perhaps letting some of them know for the first time that you're actually an item.

You can face reality tomorrow.",3,aries,2018
31,"Is your love interest out of town, Aries? If so, you might spend much of the day feeling lonely and gloomy. Your friend misses you, too, so don't think you'll be alone for long.

Hang in there!",3,aries,2018
1,"Love matters could appear to be moving far more slowly than you'd like, Aries. Both you and your romantic interest may be overloaded with responsibilities now and unable to see each other much. It's frustrating, but you'll get through it. In the meantime, don't let your insecurities get the better of you. Just because your friend is busy doesn't mean that your relationship is on the rocks. Be patient!",4,aries,2018
2,"You might experience some mental distractions that pull you in different directions today, Aries. There could be a stubborn internal/external battle brewing. Realize that being in the middle is to your advantage. Look at the situation as a way to learn something about yourself and others. Understanding your opposition's viewpoint will help you. Incorporate the old and the new into your way of thinking.",4,aries,2018
3,"You might be much more aware of yourself than usual and hyper-alert to every move you make today, especially around others, Aries. You're feeling self-conscious about your words, and you could be constantly wondering if you're saying the right thing to the right person at the right time. Too much self-analysis of could drive you completely insane if you aren't careful. Try not to take everything so seriously.",4,aries,2018
4,"You could come into conflict with someone who has a very inclusive attitude, Aries. Perhaps he or she encourages a humanistic approach that you find unrealistic and even a bit offputting. State exactly how you feel, but make sure you have the facts to back up your point and prepare for a counter argument. A great deal of fantasy is tossed around as truth, so it's important that you not add to it.",4,aries,2018
5,"After a few days that were a bit serious, Aries, today you awake with a light heart and boundless energy! Your capacity for seduction will be at its peak, so why not use it to your advantage?

6,"It isn't always pleasant to have to question oneself, Aries, but this is the main objective of today's planetary energies - to launch you into new adventures.

Just be honest with yourself.",4,aries,2018
7,"You could be feeling restless and frustrated due to a temporary separation from a partner, Aries, perhaps a business partner but more likely a romantic one.

Get together with friends and have some fun. The time will pass more quickly.",4,aries,2018
8,"Today you might feel the urge to write, Aries. This could involve nothing more than a lengthy letter or email to a friend, but it could also be creative work, such as a novel, essay, screenplay, or poem.

Don't be surprised if you come up with more questions than answers.",4,aries,2018
9,"Money problems could be on your mind, Aries, perhaps more so than necessary. You might have a tendency to blow them out of proportion and think they're worse than they are.

Relax!",4,aries,2018

Invite a friend or love partner over to watch a movie with you.",4,aries,2018
11,"You've been juggling career, romance, and creative interests for the past year, Aries. This is apt to continue. However, you could find yourself building a new career involving writing or speaking, perhaps in addition to your current career.

12,"Love and romance should be flying high for you now, Aries. If you're single, you could soon form an incredible relationship.

Make use of them and you may find the kind of love of which most people can only dream.",4,aries,2018
13,"Boy, your life seems seriously out of balance, doesn't it, Aries? Today provides an opportunity to rethink what is truly important. Consider exercise as one way to improve your health and manage your stress level. Once you get started with a healthy regimen, you'll see how it helps you gain perspective. It's likely that the cause of all this stress can be eliminated when viewed through a different lens.",4,aries,2018
14,"A friend or family member could be feeling rather grim, taciturn, and not open to communication. He or she could have you wondering if you've done something wrong, or they're angry with you. If you use your warmth and generosity of spirit to induce this person to open up, Aries, you'll probably find that the issues have nothing to do with you. You might even help relieve them! Tonight, prepare everyone's favorite meal.",4,aries,2018
15,"You might find yourself unexpectedly busy today, Aries. It could be that you'd planned to spend the day tidying up and reorganizing your home. A change of plans could mean you spend most of the day at the office handling one crisis after another. Perhaps a friend calls in need of your help. You could find it difficult to switch gears, but by the end of the day you'll be happy that you could help.",4,aries,2018
16,"There is a possibility that you'll fall into a bit of a regression today as old feelings of anxiety or inadequacy surface.

With the intensity of the planetary energies at play, you're at risk of overreacting.",4,aries,2018
18,"This is bound to be a wonderful day, Aries. You're looking and feeling great and it shows! This is a day of kindness and cooperation. You could find that your family pitches in to help at home without being asked. Your romantic partner might volunteer to clean out the garage and your children start to clean their rooms. This definitely isn't your typical day! Enjoy the harmony that reigns today.",4,aries,2018
19,"Those who know the real you find your lack of confidence frustrating, Aries. Your talents are startling to mere mortals, yet you rarely take credit for all your abilities. Today you get an opportunity to participate in a project that could make or break your career. You may hesitate, weigh your capabilities in your mind, and come up short. Not only can you do this, you can do it better than anyone else!",4,aries,2018
20,"The more you talk to people, the more successful you'll be, Aries. Everyone is a valuable resource, so tap in to this boundless well.

21,"Are you having problems with the lighting or heating in your home, Aries? If so, you might not be able to get a professional out today. There could be problems in the entire neighborhood.

Think of it as an adventure!",4,aries,2018
22,"Communication with friends and partners should be clear, open, honest, and supportive today, Aries. Camaraderie flows freely, and affection is shown without restraint or overkill. If you're presently involved but not yet committed, a declaration of love and an expression of desire to move the relationship to the next level could be in the wind. At the very least, your lover should pay you a compliment or two!",4,aries,2018
23,"Sex and romance are top priority for you today, Aries. You're looking especially beautiful, you're feeling especially sensual, and you could well attract admiring looks from strangers. You might want to indulge in some new clothes or perhaps new cologne. This is definitely the perfect day to schedule an intimate evening with a love partner. If you can, go for it. It might be a day or two before your schedules mesh, however. Be patient!",4,aries,2018
24,"Love is very much in the air today, Aries, so take advantage of this auspicious environment! Invite your loved one over to play hide and seek under the bedcovers! Or, if you don't have a playmate in your life at the moment, find other ways to fulfill the passion you feel. Spend the afternoon reading a good novel or invite a friend to watch a movie with you. Have a good time!",4,aries,2018
25,"Change is in the air, Aries. Whether it's a dramatic change of faith or a major shift in your life's goals, prepare yourself for a profound transformation. It's likely due to the fact that you now have more freedom to do what you want, when you want. Perhaps a financial windfall has made this possible. Take care to choose your new path wisely. It doesn't offer you the choice of returning to your old lifestyle.",4,aries,2018
26,"You can relax a little at last! That's what you could be thinking with today's celestial energy. The time is perfect to get ready for the challenges that up to now were just anxieties inside you.

27,"Don't be surprised if you have a desire to redecorate. The celestial energies have put you in the mood to rearrange your house a bit. Take care to not go overboard, Aries. You have a tendency to turn little projects into big ones. For now, content yourself with buying some flowering plants and perhaps new area rugs and throw pillows. Leave the kitchen and bath renovations for later.",4,aries,2018
28,"A member of your household could be going through some rough times, Aries, and as a result might become overly dependent on your moral and emotional support. This is flattering, but it could also be a drain on your energy. Carefully consider what you really need to say to your friend. Sometimes you have to hit a person over the head with the truth (figuratively speaking) in order to wake them up.",4,aries,2018
29,"A festival, rally, or other mass event could occur today in your community, Aries. It could center on a social, ecological, or political issue. You could well decide to attend in the company of a romantic partner, and perhaps a group of friends, too. This event could prove exciting for you, although some of what you learn there might be unsettling. Take a notebook and plenty of pens. You'll want to keep a record.",4,aries,2018
30,"A contract of some kind, perhaps involving the home, might need some careful consideration today, Aries. You could find it a little difficult to understand, as it could be full of fine print and legalese. Don't be afraid to ask someone with a little more savvy to explain what you're trying to read. It's important that you know all the ins and outs before signing anything, for your own peace of mind, if nothing else.",4,aries,2018
1,"Today's planetary energies will be very demanding, Aries. As you agonize over whether or not you're up to “standard,"" the planets, in a very cheeky way, respond that you are not! That's because you're moving too quickly. The change in direction that you're making at the moment is profound, yet you're trying to take it lightly. Dare to slow down and go deeper.",5,aries,2018
2,"When we have found our path, we naturally want to start to walk down it, Aries. The reverse isn't true despite what you seem to believe. It's quite futile to learn how to walk when you don't know which path to walk upon. This may seem a little obscure to you, and yet it's true. Desire is what creates aptitude, not the reverse.",5,aries,2018
3,"This is your day to shine, Aries. Just make sure you don't do so at someone else's expense. You're feeling more self-confident than usual, which may be hard for you to believe.

You need to be surrounded and encouraged by people who believe in you, Aries, and it's good for you have people around to support you. If you do meet this kind of person, don't be a showoff.

Work and play are likely to present you with exciting opportunities for advancement.",5,aries,2018
8,"Matters of the heart are likely to get a bit sticky, Aries. Perhaps you feel as if someone is shutting off from you and being very stubborn about it. Perhaps this person is giving you the cold shoulder and refusing to acknowledge you until you crawl back with an apology. The problem is that your pride is stubborn, and your view on the matter is equally so, making any resolution difficult.",5,aries,2018
9,"Have you been reviewing your family history lately, Aries? Of special interest is your cultural background. What educational, social, and religious environment were you born into? What are its values? In the end, do you feel a strong affinity with them now or are those views different from the ones you hold? These are interesting avenues of thought for you today.",5,aries,2018
10,"It isn't always easy to win the admiration you expect from your partner, Aries. But in this area today seems to be better than most.

Your efforts at physical or intellectual seduction are most effective when they're subtle.",5,aries,2018
11,"The day ahead will be as busy as can be. Matters that had been left unsettled are now becoming urgent. Today brings an opportunity to release some steam, Aries, but it's also time to realize the toll these stressful situations take on your physical health. So set some time aside for relaxation, but not before you've resolved outstanding issues once and for all.",5,aries,2018
12,"You don't suffer fools gladly, and superficial fools even less so. You have a mind to teach those around you a lesson. You're uncompromising today, and you can't understand why others don't have your same high standards. But are you truly as honest as you expect others to be? Remember that the quality of an artistic endeavor, in particular, is likely to be judged differently by each person who experiences it.",5,aries,2018

14,"You have acquired some sound confidence in yourself, Aries. Now it is time for you to show everyone else by actually putting it to use in your life.

You'll knock ‘em dead!",5,aries,2018
15,"There is something in the air today pushing you toward change or renewal, Aries. Is it time to change your wardrobe or redecorate your home? If so, this is the day. If you have monetary restrictions, you'll find it just as fulfilling (and a whole lot cheaper) to simply rid your home of all the things that just aren't ""you"" anymore. Surround yourself with the things you love.",5,aries,2018
16,"It's never very agreeable to have to question oneself, Aries, but this is the main objective of today's celestial aspect. You'll soon be launched into new adventures.

At the same time, you don't want be so overly dramatic that you blow things out of proportion.",5,aries,2018
18,"You might have some strong hesitations during the day, Aries. You may have to cover up the truth or, on the contrary, say it out loud. If this is the case, say what's on your mind. You'll be supported by the current planetary positions, which will help you formulate your ideas in a way that won't shock people, and, in fact, might even sway them to your point of view.",5,aries,2018
19,"Do you say yes every time someone asks for a favor, Aries? Is it sometimes hard to find time for yourself because you're so busy coming to the rescue of a friend or family member?

Take care of yourself before taking care of everyone else!",5,aries,2018
20,"It might be hard to find the exact direction you're looking for today, Aries. It could be that there's a strong force urging you to slow down and be more practical with your energy.

Remember that the world doesn't revolve around you, regardless of how much you might like to think it does.",5,aries,2018
21,"Chances are that there will be an emotional bite to the day that might put something of a hostile tone on anything you encounter, Aries. The key is to not get so fixed in your ways that you turn away from new experiences. You'll find that interaction with others is exactly what's needed in order to keep things in balance. The masculine and feminine sides of your being are coming together quite nicely.",5,aries,2018
22,"Why not radically change the way you behave toward others, Aries? You're in the process of orienting yourself toward establishing relationships that are more solid and enriching, with far fewer risks involved. This wasn't the case before. When you don't try so hard to seduce and impress, your audience claps louder. Just be yourself, and gain approval.",5,aries,2018

Be careful of automatically assuming the dominant position before learning what other people feel about the situation.

One thing to watch out for, however, is that you keep at least one foot on the ground at all times. Make sure you have a stable platform of honesty and practicality from which to work.

They've been pushing you to get more freedom into your life. If this is indeed the case, you can feel quite sure that they've come under a cosmic influence. That's no reason for you to agree. Freedom or lack of freedom is completely subjective.",5,aries,2018

There are great opportunities waiting if you do, especially when you team up with others. Attend a party or any sort of social gathering where you can proudly display your elegant attire to the crowd.",5,aries,2018
31,"You may feel a bit restless because you know something is brewing but can't seem to get hold of it, Aries. This energy is like a river rushing beneath your feet while you stand on a bridge. The water is tempting, yet you can't summon up the courage to jump in. Don't feel like you have to be a part of everything. Perhaps your destiny lies on the other side of the bridge.",5,aries,2018
1,"You may feel like you're walking on burning coals today, Aries. Someone has tossed you the ball and you need to figure out what to do with it.

The key is to stay flexible and go with the flow when unexpected events occur.",6,aries,2018
2,"You might find yourself in the public eye at some point today, Aries. This is fine, since you're looking and feeling great. You're likelier than usual to project warmth and friendliness to others.

3,"Today you might feel especially idealistic regarding your relationships, Aries. You're likely to see those closest to you in their best light. Romantic partners may seem like characters from a fairy tale. This is a good time to move a love relationship to the next level of commitment, as long as you don't forget your partner's foibles. It's easy to love someone who seems perfect, but more realistic to love their faults as well.",6,aries,2018
4,"Travel could be on your mind. You're probably excited about a forthcoming vacation. You might need to finalize some arrangements today but find it difficult to reach people you need to speak to. This is frustrating, Aries, but it shouldn't lessen your enthusiasm. Keep trying. You'll eventually reach the appropriate person and finish whatever you're trying to accomplish. Hang in there.",6,aries,2018
5,"You may have been looking forward to a social event, group activity, or perhaps a get-together with a lover today, but circumstances beyond your control throw some unexpected obstacles in your way.

This should pass by tomorrow.",6,aries,2018
6,"Friends in creative fields might join forces with you today to start a new project that makes a difference to all of you, Aries. This could be something as mundane as a garden in a park or as exciting as a new rock band. If you've been thinking of moving in an artistic direction, this is the day to make plans. You're determined and focused and your inspiration and enthusiasm are high.",6,aries,2018
7,"Your health is likely to be glowing and your physical energy high, Aries. You'll probably want to spend some of your time today working out or otherwise getting some exercise. This gets the endorphins going so you feel that much more motivated to pursue job-related or personal projects. Relations with others should be stimulating and jovial, although not deep or intimate. Sports or games could be especially appealing.",6,aries,2018
8,"You should be feeling especially passionate today, Aries, so don't be surprised if you can't get sex and romance out of your mind. If you're currently involved, schedule an intimate evening with your lover. If you aren't involved, don't be surprised if you pull someone new and exciting under your spell. Your passions could also spill into other parts of your life, including creative and intellectual interests. Make the most of it.",6,aries,2018
9,"Generosity is one of your best qualities, Aries. You have the uncanny ability to give without expecting anything in return, and you gain a great deal of power and light from this generosity. With little effort, you could become one of those people who never expects things in return. You could become a ""saint"" in a very real way.",6,aries,2018
10,"Perhaps your family is far away and you miss them a lot, Aries. You need to realize that you can count on your friends. They'll able to prove their love for you and show you that you're as important as the air they breathe. They'll also keep people from taking advantage of you on your journey toward the impossible.",6,aries,2018
11,"You often need to thrive on personal emotions. Today will be no exception to the rule. For instance, you could try to captivate the attention of people you admire. The only problem is that they might not be receptive at first. Try to take your time. You will have other opportunities in the near future.",6,aries,2018
12,"Your intuition is heightened almost to the point of telepathy today. Aries, you may be able to sense what others want and need even before they know it themselves. You could also experience a few visionary impressions that prove valuable inspiration for creative and artistic work. When images well up from your psyche, don't dismiss them as irrelevant. They could make a big difference in your life right now.",6,aries,2018
13,"Today you might feel as if you're walking around in a daze, Aries, but it's a good daze. Your imagination and artistic abilities are sharp. Your intuition is especially attuned, and the thoughts and feelings of others are more apparent to you than they realize. You might feel unusually restless at some point and consider going for a workout, or at least a walk. Do it. Get those endorphins flowing.",6,aries,2018
14,"You love meeting people others might consider eccentric. You can't help it. You're simply attracted to them. You will probably cross the path of one of these people today, Aries. But you might have a feeling of déjà vu. As strange as it may seem, it's possible that this person will be no one but you.",6,aries,2018
15,"Today you should have a lot of vitality, Aries. Recently, you may have decided to take more matters into your own hands. Your relationships will only benefit from this decision. The conflicts you've had to deal with were generally based on a lack of understanding. You sometimes have to make compromises. Try not to be too demanding.",6,aries,2018
16,"Today you should be feeling especially intuitive, particularly where family members are concerned, Aries. It certainly won't be easy for anyone to lie to you.

Your mind is clear and active, so this is a good time to do it.",6,aries,2018

Perhaps a new opportunity has come your way, or you're thinking of becoming involved in a new enterprise on your own or with a partner. This might not be a good day to make a decision, so don't rush it. Before you make any dramatic changes, think things through carefully. You may regret it otherwise.",6,aries,2018
18,"You may be a little bit disappointed to find out that the people you think so highly of are in fact mere reflections of your own personality. The planetary alignment is trying to teach you to believe in yourself. You just lack confidence. After all, if they're admirable people, it's probably because they have great qualities - and you have them, too. Surprises are just around the corner.",6,aries,2018
19,"Are you sure that other people wouldn't like you to be in another space than where you are right now, Aries, or even be a different person than the one you always thought you were? These questions are beginning to bother you. Devote some time to thinking about them. The answers you come up with won't be entirely meaningful for a few more weeks. Try looking at the essential things today.",6,aries,2018
20,"You should make more of your own decisions, Aries. Don't let others have so much control over your life. When in a relationship, for example, you tend to let your partner dominate. You seem to no longer want to be in charge of any initiatives with regard to your joint life. Try to free yourself from this situation and take charge. You'll be a better and more valuable partner.",6,aries,2018
21,"Other responsibilities could force you to postpone work on personal projects that mean a lot to you. This could be frustrating, Aries, and you're likely to want to sequester yourself with whatever you need to do and throw yourself into getting the problem resolved as soon as possible. You'll be able to do this as long as you don't let frustrations get the best of you. Don't sabotage your efforts.",6,aries,2018
22,"This is a fantastic day for you, Aries. You'll have a great deal of physical power. Engage in activities that put this strength to good use. Tackle projects vigorously and feel free to speak up.

23,"Don't be surprised if you run into a few emotional roadblocks today, Aries. People could be quite stubborn and difficult to deal with. You may exacerbate the situation by trying to get a rise out of someone with your boisterous attitude and dramatic flair. If your efforts don't yield positive results, back off. Keep your energy to yourself and share it another time when people are more in the mood to play.",6,aries,2018
24,"This is a great day for you to get up on stage and make your presence known to the crowd, Aries. Let people know that you're the leader of the pack.

This might accomplish your ends without putting undue burdens on yourself.",6,aries,2018
27,"Worries over money could have you edgier than usual, Aries. While you may be doing well, you still could be insecure and think your funds might not stretch far enough. Try to consider the situation objectively. You'll probably be relieved by what you find. Others' demands on your time might irritate you more than usual. The best way to escape this kind of tension is to go for a workout or walk.",6,aries,2018
28,"There's a somewhat conservative air to your feelings today, Aries. You might be called on to get serious for a second and take care of business. This may not be a bad idea. Believe it or not, this grounded nature can help you move into a deeper relationship with someone special. Let your creative nature shine through and try to do more listening than talking. Make your dreams a reality.",6,aries,2018
29,"The desire for travel might hit you today, perhaps to visit a friend who lives far away, and you could set the wheels in motion to make it happen. Social events could take up your evening, Aries, and you might meet some interesting people. A friend may need a sympathetic ear. As you're especially sensitive to others right now, you're prepared to hear a sad story. Otherwise, your day should go well.",6,aries,2018
30,"You're going to get it all today, Aries. You may not be feeling especially powerful, and in fact, some around you may be trying to make you feel incompetent.

You can shoot some of the best shots today!",6,aries,2018
1,"You may sense a nervous restlessness today that urges you to take action, Aries. A journey to one place may have you bouncing off to another place that may lead you on an adventure to someplace completely different.

2,"Someone could be prodding you to take action today, Aries. It might be best if you beat them to it and motivate yourself. Stay a step or two ahead of the herd. Lead your own stampede and go wherever you want to go. It's quite likely that you'll run into conflict regarding issues about which you feel strongly. People are likely to be stubborn, so prepare yourself for a stalemate.",7,aries,2018
3,"Jump back onstage and say your peace, Aries. Your active participation in the conversation of today is critical to maintaining a healthy energy flow.

Be an active participant in all the situations you encounter.",7,aries,2018
4,"Suddenly things are coming to a head for you, Aries. The drama is escalating and you aren't sure if you can remember all your lines. Take things one step at a time.

Don't sweat the small stuff.",7,aries,2018
5,"Stop being an enabler to someone you care deeply about, Aries. It could be that you're helping to continue dangerous addictive behavior simply because you want to avoid a nasty confrontation. Realize that this is doing neither party any good. The more you perpetuate the lie, the more it will continue to hurt all parties involved. Be open and honest with your concerns.",7,aries,2018
6,"Things might get a bit confusing for you today, Aries. Don't feel like you need to make sense of it all. In fact, this task may be impossible. Just be yourself.

Open the gates of communication and let the stampede charge through.",7,aries,2018
8,"You might come across strong opposition today from someone who seems to want to cut straight through to your heart, Aries. In reality, this is a message reminding you to think about things in terms of the collective - the oneness of us all. Be aware of a greater perspective in which you see more than just your side of the issue. Talk to people you trust before making any major decisions.",7,aries,2018
9,"Unfortunately, this isn't a day for fun and games, Aries. In fact, you might feel an annoying emotional weightiness, making you feel less energetic than usual. There's a sober tone that's asking you to take a hard-nosed look at reality and make some decisions regarding goals and plans. You could feel like the timer buzzer is about to go off. The minute hand is ticking away and there are many more adventures in store.",7,aries,2018

It will almost be like you can read each other's minds!",7,aries,2018

Be prepared to stand your ground.",7,aries,2018
13,"The clouds have finally lifted and you should be able to see clearly again, Aries. The fire is burning red hot and you'll find people likely to stick up for themselves more than usual.

Make sure you have your facts straight before you open your mouth.",7,aries,2018
14,"Today you might spend a lot of time with the special person in your life, Aries. Romance and affection are definitely a powerful factor in the course of your day, but much of what might bring you closer together is conversation.

15,"Today, Aries, you could receive an affectionate, supportive letter or phone call from someone close to you. Communications with others should go smoothly, and intelligent conversations could well take place. A favorite author, musician, or actor could release a new book, album, or movie that you'll want to jump on right away. Or you might want to try your hand at such enterprises yourself. You do have the talent.",7,aries,2018
16,"New opportunities may give you a chance to increase your financial standing and expand yourself professionally. Innovations that you've produced in the past have attracted the attention of those in positions of authority, Aries, and the fruits of your labor may manifest now. Don't expect to be able to relax and enjoy them, however, as a lot of effort still lies ahead. Summon all your inner resources and charge ahead.",7,aries,2018
17,"If you were offered the opportunity to take a trip around the world, where you would see wonderful palaces and experience a timeless love affair, would you take it? The freedom would tempt you, without a doubt, but would it make you happy, Aries? Have you considered the possibility that you can create an environment here at home that gives you that same sense of freedom?",7,aries,2018
18,"A new opportunity could come your way today, Aries. It might seem like a dream come true, the chance you've been waiting for, but you'll still want to think about it a bit. The reason is that it could well disrupt your life, including your romantic circumstances. Before you commit to anything, check the facts carefully to make sure it's as good as it seems. Either way, you'll be glad you did.",7,aries,2018
19,"Aries, are you hoping to accomplish a goal that you've been working toward for a long time? Don't let delays cause you to fear that it will never happen.

You might find that clearing up these old matters allows new opportunities to flow your way.",7,aries,2018
22,"Things may roll along nicely in love and romance and then suddenly run into a snag, Aries. Perhaps you failed to recognize an important birthday or anniversary. Perhaps you were expected to act a certain way or do something you failed to do. Approach the person you hurt honestly and apologetically. You write your own rules. Your way may differ from someone else's, but that doesn't make it better or worse.",7,aries,2018
23,"You may end up scaring people with your dramatic, emotional outbursts, Aries. Your behavior is likely to be erratic. The smallest things could set you off on a crazy tirade. The root of these issues probably has to do with a need to be loved, and you feel like others don't give you the attention you think you deserve. Try not to let your happiness depend so much on others' actions. The most important love is self-love.",7,aries,2018
24,"Realize that you're the one responsible for cleaning up your own mess, Aries. If you've left your dirty clothes on the floor and the dishes unwashed, you will be the one who has to pay the consequences later on. Take responsibility for your actions.

25,"Once your brain gets hooked on something, Aries, you're likely to take it to the extreme. Be careful of overworking yourself in a certain issue that requires a more rational, temperate attitude.

Try to avoid this if you can.",7,aries,2018
29,"Tune into the thoughts of others, Aries. Focusing only on yourself means you're missing the beauty and wisdom that come from other people.

You will find that your strength is greater than ever.",7,aries,2018
31,"You have a passionate nature, Aries. Sometimes it's difficult for you when other people don't share your exuberance. This is a good time to tone things down a notch. There's some tension in the air, and your enthusiasm only serves to annoy rather than charm, as it usually does. Don't pout. It's only temporary. Tomorrow you'll be the center of attention again and bestowing hugs and kisses to all.",7,aries,2018
1,"Whether you acknowledge it or not, Aries, creation is the central theme of your life. If you aren't an artist or writer, you should be. There are plenty of creative ideas in your head clamoring to be expressed. Why not give it a try? You have nothing to lose, and you may be astonished by what you're able to produce. Your brain does have two sides. It's time to use both.",8,aries,2018
2,"Cool your jets today, Aries. This is a good time to stop and focus on you. Make sure to give your body the respect it deserves. Make sure you're fostering the kind of character you wish to become.

8,"If you're single, you could feel a very powerful attraction to someone unusual and perhaps a little wacky. If you're already in a relationship, you could glimpse a silly and rather insane side of your beloved you've never seen before. This could be a bit disconcerting but also make you laugh. That's part of the appeal of love - continuously learning about that special one.",8,aries,2018
9,"This could be a challenging day, Aries. You might receive a call that brings disconcerting news, making you angry or upset. You could be tempted to take it out on the caller, but don't.

13,"A friend who lives far away might call or email you today, Aries. Your friend may be planning to visit your area and want to get together with you.

16,"Dare to be different, Aries. It's easy to fall into routines - sleep and eat at the same time, wear the same style, and do your work the same way every day. Before you know it, you're in a rut. The only way to pull out of it is to decide to break free. Try a new hairstyle. Wear colors that are new for you. If the rut is really deep, consider a new career. Expand your horizons.",8,aries,2018

19,"Aries, you'll probably find that you have a ton of energy to put into all kinds of activities.

14,You like to recycle in your home and your workplace. Be a part of the solution instead of the problem by picking up after yourself and making sure that you aren't leaving a mess wherever you go. The state of the environment is more of a concern every day. It's up to each individual to make a difference.,11,taurus,2017
15,"Tap into your internal resources. Listen to your deepest, strongest feelings and take things slowly. Plan your actions and consider the emotions of others before you take the first step. Take advantage of the pauses in your day. Enjoy the rest and use the time to plan ahead instead of acting rashly and running full throttle to the next task.",11,taurus,2017
16,"Things are moving in opposite directions, yet you can relate and benefit from all of them. There's nothing wrong with keeping your options open. Some people like to stick with one game, while you like to play multiple hands at once. Don't let others make you feel like you need to change your way as long as you're confident that things are working for you.",11,taurus,2017
17,"Love of someone from far away could be very much on your mind today, and perhaps love for the place where the person lives. You may be bored with your routine and anxious to embrace adventure. This is a good time to plan a vacation, particularly if accompanied by a partner or close friend. Your artistic instincts could also be inspired by geniuses from other cultures.",11,taurus,2017
18,"An old friend you haven't seen in a long time could suddenly reappear. You'll be surprised by this person's achievements. This meeting or the circumstances surrounding it could mark a turning point for you. Perhaps this person inspires you, or people you meet through him or her make a difference to you. This is going to be a strange, significant day. Make the most of it!",11,taurus,2017
19,"Strong psychic impressions about absent friends or family members may come to you today. All are apt to be positive, though you might find it disconcerting. You might even think it more so if you learn your intuition was right! This tendency may continue for a while. Your sensitivity to others' thoughts and feelings is increasing. It can contribute to your understanding of them. Make the most of it.",11,taurus,2017
20,A lot of paperwork that you need to complete could have you nervous and stressed. You might experience some headaches. Don't sacrifice your well-being for this. You won't lose your focus if you have to put off some tasks until tomorrow. Calls or visitors could also get on your nerves. Turn off the phone and tell people you'll visit later. They'll understand.,11,taurus,2017
21,Be careful about declaring your love for someone when you haven't spent enough time with him or her to make that call. You may base this impulse on superficial encounters and brief conversations. You may not have the long history or deep discussions needed to know if this person is as ideal for you as you think. Don't be fooled by fast talk and high fashion.,11,taurus,2017
22,"You could feel especially amorous today. If you're romantically involved, you could have an overwhelming urge for an intimate dinner with your significant other. If you're uninvolved, expect that status to change shortly. A new person could cross your path and sweep you off your feet. Or you could see an old friend in a new light. Be prepared for anything.",11,taurus,2017
23,"Money or other resources could be made available to you today so you can increase your career prospects or advance in your occupation. You'll find this very encouraging, as you'll throw a lot of energy into this interest. This is the time to be ambitious. You have what it takes to push forward with just about anything you want to do.",11,taurus,2017
24,"Today you'll change your approach to relationships. In the past, they were based on feelings, but now you'll decide that they should be more rational. You might feel that this sudden change of attitude could detract from your happiness, but it could also lead to stronger, more stable relationships.",11,taurus,2017
25,"You should expect to feel warmth in your contact with other people today. Your relations will have something particularly tender and caring about them. It's like people are suddenly much more attentive and sensitive. The universe is like one big, happy family. You can confide in other people. Don't be afraid to talk about your most intimate feelings with a friend.",11,taurus,2017
26,"It's time to brush up on your computer skills. Technology is here to stay, so you might as well embrace it rather than resist. Your mind is eager to absorb new information. This means that you can learn the more intricate aspects of computer technology. Once you do, you'll enjoy browsing websites, shopping online, and emailing your friends near and far.",11,taurus,2017
27,"Your parents or another couple close to you may be quarreling, and you might be expected to take sides. Don't do it! It's better to stand aside and let them work it out for themselves while reminding them that you care for them both. The best you can do under these circumstances is try to help mediate a compromise, but finding a win/win situation could be hard.",11,taurus,2017
28,"Delays seem to rule the day, and there's no getting around them. Traffic snarls plague the commute and calls don't get returned. You feel as though you're spending the day stuck in a revolving door, whirling around but getting nowhere. Take heart and do your best to get through with some of your humor intact. Chocolate helps. Tomorrow will be better!",11,taurus,2017
29,"Usually you have a strong intuitive bond with those close to you, but today you might feel like that part of your brain has shut down. You could get confusing messages, or you could pick up nothing at all. You haven't lost your gift so don't worry about it. You'll have to rely on words for now!",11,taurus,2017
30,"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, as the saying goes. You're likely to receive some good news today. Don't second-guess it, or worry if you're worthy of it. Accept it for what it is, though it might be worth taking some time to consider why you feel unworthy in the first place.",11,taurus,2017
1,New winds will begin to blow away the black clouds that have been hovering over you lately. What more could you want? Today will seem like a walk in the park compared to days past! You'll breathe better and come home feeling rested. Try to interact more with the people around you. They will appreciate it if you express genuine interest in their opinions.,12,taurus,2017
2,"Be careful about opening your mouth in situations in which it isn't appropriate. When the conversation lags, you feel it's your duty to pipe up. By doing so, you may launch the conversation onto an inappropriate topic. You may want to say something just so you can shift the focus to you. The better choice is to allow the silence to sit peacefully.",12,taurus,2017
3,"You may feel weighed down by the emotional pall hanging over everything. Don't let this feeling overwhelm you, although at times this may be impossible. A good friend could call on you for help and emotional support. Don't end up turning the focus around and talking only about your experiences. Loyalty and compassion are keys for today.",12,taurus,2017
4,A touch of melancholy and moodiness might have you feeling distanced from your entourage and so you could throw yourself into solitary activities. Your concentration may not be what it should be. Get out and take a long walk or treat yourself to a meal at your favorite restaurant. Your mood will pass by tomorrow. You need to get through today!,12,taurus,2017
5,"If you aren't romantically involved, don't be surprised if romance comes your way today, perhaps in your neighborhood. Even if you are involved, you'll make a new friend. You're likely to meet someone special outside in the open air and close to a crowd of people. Therefore, this isn't a good day to stay inside, even if the weather's bad. Go see what the Universe has in store for you.",12,taurus,2017
6,"Congratulations to you! Career progress is in the wind! If you've wanted to create a dream career, you'll be able to do so today. If you've been hoping to start your own business, don't wait another moment. The next year should be a successful and profitable one for you, although not without its surprises.",12,taurus,2017
7,"Ordering one item from the menu isn't going to satisfy you today. You need a buffet table where you can try everything - either that or an eight-course meal served with a smile. You're happy to share your meal with others as long as you can have a bite of what everyone else is having as well. This is your day to skip around, try new things, and explore different perspectives.",12,taurus,2017
8,"You might be more energetic than you've felt in a long time. It's the perfect day to get busy with tasks, projects, and housework. You'll breeze through most things in no time and enjoy them. Resist any temptation to procrastinate! If you put things off, you'll miss the current cosmic support. Make a list of things to do and start. You'll be done before you know it!",12,taurus,2017
9,"Instead of directing all your energy outward and dominating the conversation with your ideas, consider listening. Let ideas flow your way. Be receptive to opinions and ideas. A wonderful mental and emotional expansion occurs when you receive instead of being so concerned about projecting out. Be more focused on what's happening on the inside instead of so worried about events on the outside.",12,taurus,2017
10,Mood swings and irritating little distractions could have you temporarily at odds with a partner. You may perceive insults where none are intended. Communication is strained. It's best to get out by yourself for a while and do something entertaining. That way you chase all the negative energy away. You can be your old charming self when you see your partner again.,12,taurus,2017
11,"Your radiance and brilliance upstage everyone else today. You're a star! Your wish is anyone's command. The people around you may be counting on you to be their leader. Although you enjoy this role, you shouldn't forget to indulge in more private pleasures. A little gift for yourself, an adventure for fun, or perhaps some time alone may be what you need.",12,taurus,2017
12,"You have a pleasant day ahead. Optimism and creativity prevail. You can avail yourself of all the freedom necessary to encounter happiness. Indeed, that newfound happiness may come in the form of a new person who makes your heart beat faster. Don't fall in love too quickly! There are plenty of opportunities now. A deep and fulfilling commitment will take time to build.",12,taurus,2017
13,"What a relief! Your energy is returning, especially regarding affairs of the heart. Today you'll be freed from the bonds of doubt about your judgment. With you, self-doubt is an especially touchy subject. You're miserable when your confidence is gone. The energy flow has been reestablished, although it may take you a few days to fully recover from the ordeal of recent weeks.",12,taurus,2017
14,"Plans for travel or advancing your education could be on your mind. Your excitement might keep you from focusing on whatever tasks you have to do. Don't worry about it. Your steadfastness will enable you to get your tasks completed in spite of anything that may distract you. Either that, or the people around you will keep reminding you of your responsibilities!",12,taurus,2017
15,"Ideas for creative projects may be flooding your mind, but they may be too general or vague to grasp. Make a list if you like, but don't feel you have to start anything today. You may need a few days to let the ideas churn around before settling on the best one to start. Be patient.",12,taurus,2017
16,"With the shifting planetary alignment, all of your efforts over the past few weeks could finally bear fruit. Success and good fortune are strongly indicated, especially where money is concerned. Worries about finances are likely to disappear, and you could even receive public recognition. This should be a satisfying period.",12,taurus,2017
17,"Yes, it's your turn now. Perhaps you've been waiting for something, but the timing hasn't been right. Perhaps there has been a mental or physical roadblock in the way. Wait no longer. The time is here. Step up and say your peace. Don't make excuses and don't hold back. The more you contribute, the more richly you'll be rewarded.",12,taurus,2017
18,"You may feel like someone is trying to rain on your parade. It's important not to forget who you are now. Don't be surprised if you feel a negative pull from someone or something. If so, step away from the situation. It's not your responsibility to make everyone happy. Don't bring yourself down as you try to bring others up.",12,taurus,2017
19,"There's a great deal of fuel for your fire today, so go for it. Spend time with children and be creative. Put your fun-loving personality to good use by encouraging others to play along. This is a good day to offer your talents to group efforts. You'll be a welcome addition to every social situation.",12,taurus,2017
20,"You may experience a burst of physical energy today that urges you to bring life to your emotions. Act out your true feelings at all times. Make it known that you're a force to be reckoned with. There's no need to be threatening or outwardly aggressive. Know that if someone taunts you, you have the strength and courage to defend yourself.",12,taurus,2017
21,"Capitalize on the boisterous energy present today. This is a wonderful time to express yourself in a powerful manner. You may go to extremes on this level, so be careful how you wield your power. The key is not to get too attached to your ideas and any results that you want. Things will happen as they need to happen.",12,taurus,2017
22,"You're cleaning, sweeping, and tidying up your relationships as never before. More remains to be done, but in the end, your relationships will take on completely different forms. Today, for example, someone in your group will back up your ideas. You're in the process of changing. Everyone who matters is going to support you.",12,taurus,2017
23,"Sudden financial success could produce upheaval in your lifestyle. Therefore, rethink your current situation and consider the pursuit of cherished old dreams that you may have abandoned. Spiritual goals and interests may change. Old friends could be left behind and new friendships begun. It's important to remember that once you embark on this new path, there'll be no turning back.",12,taurus,2017
24,You've made it over the hump. You've moved beyond the problems of the recent past and you're entering a more peaceful phase. You'll soon complete your projects at work. Your domestic life will be the picture of bliss and harmony. Enjoy this period of rest and relaxation because it will be followed by a period of intense longing that requires your total attention.,12,taurus,2017
25,"Your words may get you into trouble today, so be careful of what you say. Try to keep a lid on hasty comments fueled by intense emotions. These comments may come out the wrong way and be used against you later. Bring your cheerful disposition to the group and leave your stubborn attitude at home. Goals and discipline may be major themes today.",12,taurus,2017
26,"You'll have to demonstrate your endurance today. Much is required of you, and you have no choice but to make the contribution expected of you. There's no way around it. You're a key player in the events swirling around you. Surely you've noticed. Much as you'd like to take off for a vacation, you can't do it now.",12,taurus,2017
27,"In the past few days, you've made a resolution to work steadily, seek stability, and follow your plans to the letter. So the day ahead will come as a rude surprise. You can expect to receive news that challenges the rigid program you've set for yourself, or meet people who are determined to discourage you. Overcome these obstacles or they'll overcome you.",12,taurus,2017
28,Take some emotional time off today if you feel you deserve it. You're getting so wrapped up in other people's dramas that you're feeling drained when it comes to your own concerns. Calm down and relax physically and mentally. Getting too stressed about a certain issue isn't healthy. You may end up foiling the situation much more than if you left it alone. Come back to it later.,12,taurus,2017
29,"An unexpected visit or call from a friend could bring exciting news. You might decide to get together with this person and celebrate. Good fortune comes your way from an unforeseen source, but don't waste time wondering about it. Make the most of it. Future successes may hinge upon it. By day's end you might be aiming for entirely different goals than you were this morning.",12,taurus,2017
30,"There may be a rather confusing element to the day for you, Taurus, in which you feel tempted to act but not all the pieces seem to be in place. It could be hard to make a decision about things since the facts seem to be quite clouded. You're better off spending this day enjoying your friends or your favorite hobby rather than trying to make any major life decisions or commitments.",12,taurus,2017
31,"Normally you tend to be a very spiritually oriented person, Taurus, but today you might find metaphysical concepts of all kinds rather baffling. Whether these are ideas you've embraced for a long time or new ones you've just discovered, you may find nagging little doubts creeping in, temporarily causing your faith to waver. This is a healthy development, however. A little doubt now and then can weed out concepts that don't work for you and reaffirm your belief in others.",12,taurus,2017
1,"If you aren't already into real estate, gardening, or interior decorating, Taurus, today you might discover a talent for one or all of these fields and decide to pursue it. You might have it in mind as a possible future source of income, and therefore you could consider looking into getting some formal training in the field. Which one you choose, if any, is of course up to you. Consider them all carefully and then decide which is best.",1,taurus,2018
2,"You may find yourself overwhelmed with information today, Taurus. By midday both your voice mailbox and your email box could be full up. It seems everyone needs a piece of you today. Don't try and accomplish everything that people expect of you today; it simply isn't possible. Instead, make your own decisions about what is important and what isn't. You may get some resistance from higher-ups, but in the end they will see the wisdom of your thinking.",1,taurus,2018
3,"You have a lot of charm and tremendous social skills, Taurus. This is an unbeatable combination, and is especially strengthened with the current astral energy. Be sure to go the extra mile today, even if you aren't in the mood to do so. Someone in a position of power and authority may ask you to join him or her for dinner, or perhaps you'll be invited to ""perform"" at a party. These are ideal opportunities to showcase your talents, so embrace them rather than shy away from them.",1,taurus,2018
4,"You have an urge to hop on a plane and leave the country, Taurus. It seems that this is the only way to free yourself from the mountain of professional and social obligations that are piling up. How can you ever hope to attend all of them, or even half? Have you considered that you may not need to? Send someone else in your stead, perhaps, or simply respond that you can't make it. You wouldn't be the first to say no. You are entitled to some downtime.",1,taurus,2018
5,"A goal that you may have been working toward for a long time might still seem very distant right now, Taurus. Therefore, today you could actually find yourself giving up on it. This doesn't imply that what you want will never happen. In fact, sometimes letting go of a dream can actually cause it to manifest. Remember this when you start to brood on your lack of success so far. All is not hopeless!",1,taurus,2018
6,"Today you might host a gathering of people interested in psychic or metaphysical matters, Taurus. A very special guest could give a talk or lead a discussion group. This could be fascinating for everyone present. You'll gain a reputation as a wonderful host, even though all you really do is pass out cookies and pour the coffee. You, above all, should have a great time and enjoy talking with your friends. Have fun!",1,taurus,2018
7,"Hobbies and diversions are wonderful; no one will argue this with you, Taurus. But there comes a time when you use your hobbies as a way to avoid other responsibilities. Your intuitive levels are at an all-time high right now. Perhaps you can use them to your own benefit. Try blocking out your worries over the mundane, day-to-day issues so that you can determine why you're avoiding the tasks at hand.",1,taurus,2018
8,"Too much food and drink could have you feeling a little out of sorts today, Taurus. Some friends might have taken you out and exposed you to the most tempting of food and drink. This is always fun, but today you have to face the consequences! A workout fueled with water could help burn off any toxins or extra calories, and a nap just might complete the process so you're feeling like your old self again. Get going!",1,taurus,2018
9,"How annoying when work gets in the way of pleasure, but there are times when professional opportunities are simply too good to pass up. That beguiling creature you've had your eye on will just have to wait for you another day. For now, Taurus, focus on the business at hand. With the current aspect at play, the payoff could be tremendous!",1,taurus,2018
10,"Do you have a date tonight with someone special, Taurus? If so, expect some delays. You might get tied up with doing your daily errands. This could be frustrating both for you and your partner, but you'll eventually touch base. Don't get so upset over the delays that you're in a bad mood when you meet. This won't help at all! Just hang in there and you'll still have a great evening.",1,taurus,2018
11,"Some rather bizarre dreams could come to you tonight, Taurus. The symbols may include people or objects that you would never have thought of consciously in a hundred years. Nonetheless, they do have meaning for you right now. Sit down and make a list of the symbols and events in the dream, then try to analyze what they mean to you. Your dream is trying to tell you something important. Make the most of it.",1,taurus,2018
12,"Your relationships with just about everyone - friends, lovers, children, colleagues, and even strangers - should be smooth, warm, and supportive today, Taurus. Feelings are easily expressed, although more on a subtle than a verbal level. New business opportunities may open up through contact with new and interesting people. Social events and group activities should therefore contribute more to your personal growth and emotional well-being than they usually do. Make the most of them!",1,taurus,2018
13,"Today you might want to concentrate on one of your private projects for which you have a lot of passion, Taurus. If one of your family members keeps you from working on this project, explain just how important this is for you. Usually you work very hard, so you deserve to do whatever you want to do in your off time. Just try to be tactful! They will understand!",1,taurus,2018
14,"Some new equipment made available for your use might prove fascinating, Taurus, and you're apt to want to learn as much as you can about how it works. Therefore, this is a great day to increase your computer skills. You might also want to try your hand at sound or video recording. Art combined with modern technology could well be a primary focus for today. Learn as much as you can, and have some fun in the process.",1,taurus,2018
15,"Some projects requiring a lot of thought, which you may have been working on for a long time, could well be completed today. Your efforts are definitely going to be appreciated by those who matter, Taurus, and you might even receive public acknowledgment of some kind. A rise in income could be just over the horizon. You've worked hard to be where you are and can't be blamed if you give yourself a pat on the back. Go to it!",1,taurus,2018
16,"A goal that you've been working toward for a long time and in which you've placed a lot of hope and confidence, may suddenly seem in doubt today, Taurus. This doesn't mean it's dead in the water by any means. It only means that for now you just need to work a little harder and rebuild your faith in it. Tomorrow your doubts could well be a thing of the past. Work hard and hang in there.",1,taurus,2018
17,"Today sensitivity combines with mental astuteness to bring your innate practicality and efficiency to the surface. You'll probably have more than one chance to make use of this, Taurus, whether it relates to work you do at home, you're helping out a friend, or you're working with a group. Family members and others find it easy to communicate with you and might come to you with matters they need to sort out. Enjoy your day.",1,taurus,2018
18,"Discussions with others could result in new plans and opportunities for advancing yourself on any level you wish: career, financial, or social. Inner resources may come to light that you might not have been aware of before. You could also decide to make use of creative abilities that have lain fallow for a while. Give some careful thought to the next couple of months, Taurus. So many ideas may come your way that it might not be feasible to try to use them all.",1,taurus,2018
19,"Today begins an exciting period in your personal life, Taurus. It's time for new beginnings in your relationship. You may be ready to make the changes you and your partner have been considering for quite some time. Moving in together, doing some construction on your house, buying a summer home, or perhaps even having a child - start making those plans that symbolize the stability of your relationship.",1,taurus,2018
20,"Not all friendships are the same, Taurus. You may have learned that the hard way, but that's OK. Today you could feel like putting your friendships in some kind of order and getting a bit of perspective on things. It's time to figure which of your friends are really there for you when you need them, which of them show you how much they care about you, and which ones do not. Each kind of friendship can be useful to you in its own way. Don't be afraid to admit this.",1,taurus,2018
21,"Your level of physical and mental energy should be very high today, Taurus, and so you could feel restless throughout the morning. As a result, you might spend your afternoon and evening out and about, shopping, paying visits, or attending classes or lectures. Some stimulating discussions could take place. At some point, you might find yourself admiring a park or garden. Don't try to do too much, and enjoy your day.",1,taurus,2018
22,"Family and friends may gather for an intimate get-together at your home or perhaps at the home of a neighbor. At some point, expect an exciting phone call. You should be feeling pretty secure in relationships of all kinds, Taurus, from business partnerships to close friends to love partners. Information provided by someone else could give you some ideas as to how to fix up your house in a new and different way.",1,taurus,2018
23,"Romantic relationships take on a fairytale aura, Taurus, bringing up the kind of desire, passion, and sense of unity associated with Lancelot and Guinevere. Therefore, this should be a wonderful day to schedule an intimate evening with a romantic partner. You could feel so much in tune with your friend that you may come with the same words at the same time. Enjoy this wonderful feeling, but don't lose sight of reality.",1,taurus,2018
24,"More than likely there is a person in your world who desperately wants to get closer to you, Taurus. Conflict is apt to arise tonight if you don't open up and let this person in a bit closer. It could be that you're quick to snap back with a forceful opinion, but be careful that you don't scare them away entirely. This person wants to share more of an intimate space with you, but perhaps they just don't know how.",1,taurus,2018
25,"Today you're likely to be feeling especially passionate, sexy, and desirous of a romantic encounter, Taurus. You might even have a hot date scheduled. However, don't be surprised if it has to be postponed for reasons beyond the control of either you or your partner. If you can't do otherwise, you might try to sublimate those feelings through creative activities. Engrossing novels and movies could also prove a good outlet, although never as good as the real thing!",1,taurus,2018
26,"Some unusual dreams may come to you tonight, Taurus, and you might awaken with the idea that they're very important. The images should be very clear, however, and you probably won't have much trouble working out what they mean. Intellect joins with intuition today in a rush of insightfulness. Make the most of this advantage now, and later decide how best to act on your revelations.",1,taurus,2018
27,"It's time to put away the sentimental feelings for the day and move to something new, Taurus. Stop pulling out old photo albums and crying about past experiences. You will only succeed in sinking into a puddle of tears that you can't pull yourself out of. Instead, this is a day to look to the future and plan for new experiences that you can enjoy with the people you love.",1,taurus,2018
28,"A conflict between career obligations and home responsibilities could present itself today, Taurus. You're likely to feel totally powerless in the situation, so it could cause you to feel irritable and be more snappish than usual. Try to think clearly and find a solution for your conundrum, then act on it. Avoid the temptation to quarrel with others. In the evening, go out dancing! Work off some of that frustrated energy.",1,taurus,2018
29,"Remember that there is a spirit in everything around you, Taurus. Just because we can't perceive something with our eyes, ears, nose, mouth, or fingers doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Pay respect to the force field that surrounds us, and to the animate and inanimate forms that exist in our everyday life. You are apt to perceive life as if it were a prayer today.",1,taurus,2018
30,"Are you falling for someone you know on the job, Taurus? If so, you might find out that your feelings are reciprocated. Your friend could telephone or email and invite you out, away from work. Some other people might be present, but this won't stop you from getting better acquainted and realizing that this relationship shows promise. The only problem is that you may have to keep it under your hat for a while, at least at work.",1,taurus,2018
31,"Today you could be hit with some exciting news, Taurus. It could involve new people and new equipment coming onto the scene. It could involve an entirely new project or course of action that you never would have imagined. This is likely to shape up to be a lucky break for you, as the new situation probably suits your skills and talents nearly perfectly. Make the most of this opportunity. It could make a big difference to you.",1,taurus,2018
1,"More than likely there was at least one time in your life in which you felt like the ugly ducking, Taurus. Perhaps this had something to do with your weight. Whether this feeling of insecurity or self-consciousness was self-imposed or not, it’s time to rid yourself of such thoughts and feelings. Today is a day to love every bit of yourself. Have pride in your body inside and out.",2,taurus,2018
2,"You may have the sense that something is going on around you that you just can’t seem to grab hold of, Taurus. Your mind is bouncing this way and that as if you’re watching a ball in a tennis match. Things may be changing rapidly around you. You could feel like it’s time to jump on the bandwagon. Look before you leap, and go with the flow. Remember that the best decisions aren’t always made with the brain; sometimes they’re made with the heart.",2,taurus,2018
3,"Are you worried about the psychological and emotional state of a friend, Taurus? Don't get yourself too worked up over it. Your friend is probably more troubled about money than anything else. If this is your love partner, you should be especially careful not to push for confidences, as this could be a turn-off. Your beloved will talk to you when the time is right. In the meantime, be patient and a good listener.",2,taurus,2018
4,"If your lifestyle is considerably different than that of others, resist feeling self-conscience about it today, Taurus. Try to remember that you chose the life you have for specific reasons. Even if you've come to a point where you’re considering a change, there’s no need to feel badly, ashamed, or embarrassed about where you are now. Everyone has to make his or her own way. If this conforms to the norm, that's fine. If it doesn't, that's fine, too.",2,taurus,2018
5,"Take charge of your overall health today, Taurus. You’ll likely wake up feeling energetic and well. Seize this opportunity to be active in doing things that will help continue your good feelings. Consider all aspects of your health, including emotional and spiritual. If you can, sit outside in the sunshine and fresh air to consider the areas of your life that could use a workout. Take a walk, do some gardening, engage in something both creative and physical.",2,taurus,2018
6,"When was the last time you used a pen and paper, Taurus? In this age of computers, the keyboard has all but replaced these wonderful tools. In the same way that walking provides much more than fresh air, the kinesthetic value of the rhythmic motion of writing with a pen is far more soothing and even healing than most realize. Moving your hand across the page can feel good and unlock places within you that aren't accessed by typing. Try it today.",2,taurus,2018
7,"If something is bothering you today, Taurus, consider talking with your mother or an older person you feel comfortable with. No matter where we are in life, there remains a part of us that draws support and nurturing from someone with more experience. Draw some strength from this valuable resource by visiting or calling. Remember to express your gratitude for this supportive relationship.",2,taurus,2018
8,"It's the perfect day to do some planning, Taurus. Take the time on a regular basis to think about the things you want to do and accomplish. It’s essential for feeling you have control over your life. It can be almost impossible to reach your goals without a concrete plan. Just as you wouldn't build a house without a plan, it isn't wise to build a life without one either.",2,taurus,2018
9,"Good decision making will be a prominent asset today, Taurus. It's an excellent time to make a list of things that you’ve either put off or haven't been able to settle on. This doesn't need to be things that are just related to work or finances. Consider putting effort into your personal life as well. If there are issues surrounding friends, your romantic partner, or family, this is a great opportunity to think up options.",2,taurus,2018
10,"Some revealing conversations with friends or relatives could bring up old traumatic memories from the past that you may have been repressing. This could shed light on a lot of obstacles you've been encountering lately, Taurus, and thus enable you to release these emotions and do away with the obstacles. Once that happens, the sky's the limit! Your personal power and self-confidence should be stronger than ever. Go for the gold!",2,taurus,2018
11,"Some welcome visitors from far away could come to see you today and cause temporary chaos in your home. You'll be glad to see them, however, Taurus, as they'll have some great news and fascinating information to pass on to you and your family. You'll want to introduce them to other friends who share your interests. This could give rise to a horrendously messy house, but you'll have fun anyway. Prepare for a highly social evening!",2,taurus,2018
12,"Some rather tedious and boring paperwork you have to handle for your business might be a pain in the neck now, Taurus, but it should bring a lot of benefits to you later. Therefore, you'll want to exercise your usual conscientiousness in order to assure that it gets completed. Your diligence and dedication should attract the attention of those in authority, so expect advancement in some way. Onward and upward!",2,taurus,2018
13,"There are forces working in your favor that you should be sure to latch onto and take advantage of, Taurus. You’ll find that your sense of duty and ability to plan are paying off in a very positive way. You’ll find that you’re able to check quite a few things off your list today. Think before you act and take a time-out to rest and regroup if you need to.",2,taurus,2018
14,"Someone close to you could develop some strange symptoms that cause this person to panic. It never hurts to consult a doctor, but when this person does, he or she is likely to find that these problems are probably nothing more than stress, too much work, or overindulgence in food or drink. Therefore, don't you panic, too! You might find yourself making phone calls or running errands to enable your friend to get some rest.",2,taurus,2018
15,"Business matters take a sudden turn for the better, Taurus. Paperwork may need to be executed. A new sense of self-confidence contributes to these developments, and the more good things that happen to you, the more confident you’ll feel. Your physical appearance could assume more importance in your mind than usual, since you'll want the way you look to match the way you feel inside. Buy some new clothes and keep working. The sky's the limit.",2,taurus,2018
16,"Expect a lot of letters and phone calls from lovers, close friends, or children today, Taurus. You might also want to make a few yourself. Some positive and interesting information may have come your way that you'll want to share with those close to you. You could also want to try your hand at writing. You'll want to make sure that you remember whatever it is you learn today, Taurus, as it could prove valuable in the future.",2,taurus,2018
17,"Temporary difficulties at home might cause you to want to stay and resolve them rather than go to work or anywhere else. However, Taurus, career matters may also be pressing, so you're likely to be in a bit of a quandary. At this time, the wisest decision is likely to be to take care of your personal life first. Professional matters will still be waiting for you tomorrow.",2,taurus,2018
18,"Someone who is a student of natural healing may come to visit you and share some ideas today. You tend to be interested in matters concerning health, and you might want to learn not only about herbs and nutrition but also spiritual healing. This is a good time to train your own healing abilities, Taurus, as your sensitivity is high and you’re more able than usual to tune in to the healing energies.",2,taurus,2018
19,"A friend, perhaps a woman, could well be upset or even angry with you today, Taurus. Money might be involved in some way. There may be nothing you can do to reassure her at this time, so it's best to give what reassurances you can and then back off. Whatever has gone wrong, she's probably overreacting, and eventually she'll see that. In the meantime, you do what you can to work off your own anxieties. Hang in there!",2,taurus,2018
20,"A family member could be feeling a little down, Taurus, and you may be tempted to give him or her a pep talk to get them going again. Don't. They won't respond to it, and this could create tension in the home. Your own self-confidence is probably at an all-time low. You tend to be your own worst critic in the best of times, but today you're a bit confused. Try to be fair to everyone around you, especially yourself.",2,taurus,2018
21,"If you've got something you're trying to study, Taurus, this isn’t the day to do it. Your concentration is likely to be off, and what you're reading will probably look like Greek to you. Unless it’s really necessary, it would be best to put the books aside until tomorrow, since you probably won't absorb much today. Trying to read could give rise to the illusion that you've learned something. Be on the safe side and put it off!",2,taurus,2018
22,"Today will be a lovely combination of harmony and passion. Make the most of it, Taurus. With things running so smoothly at work, there's no reason you can't leave the office early to prepare for a special evening with your partner. Pull out all the stops tonight. Scented candles, a fabulous meal, and an even more fabulous outfit. Have a rich, gooey dessert on hand (although it's likely you won't get around to eating it).",2,taurus,2018
23,"It’s possible that you could fear for your job today, Taurus. Fortunately, those fears are unfounded. There is a lot of upheaval occurring at work. You’re best advised to steer clear of it, if you can. If you continue to do your job well, you’re likely to receive a bonus or promotion as a result of your efforts. You've earned it.",2,taurus,2018
24,"Construction on streets or buildings might make it difficult for you to get around your neighborhood today, Taurus. Traffic could be backed up for blocks. If you must run errands, either walk or get them done early in the day. The work could foul up the phone lines as well, at least for a while, so you might miss some calls you needed to take. This could be a frustrating day. Keep yourself busy at home.",2,taurus,2018
25,"You’ve always had psychic ability, and today it’s at a peak, Taurus. Perhaps not coincidentally, you’re likely to be contacted by a close friend or lover from your past. He or she isn’t calling to renew your relationship but rather for advice. Your heightened abilities today make you the ideal confidant. Listen closely and advise what your heart tells you is right.",2,taurus,2018
26,"You can expect a warm and friendly environment at work today, Taurus. Enjoy the conversations with your co-workers, but don't take anything at face value. There may be someone in your midst out to sabotage you. You don't need to worry about it too much, just take care to document any ideas or insights you have. You may need proof that they’re original.",2,taurus,2018
27,"You're finally setting in motion some longstanding goals of yours, Taurus. Good for you! But even though everything is in place and you're ready to go, it's possible that you'll receive notice today of some delay in your plans. The frustration feels unbearable. But when you step back and look at the bigger picture, you'll see that ultimately this delay is in your best interests.",2,taurus,2018
28,"Today you might notice a change in yourself, Taurus. You could look in the mirror and see that you suddenly look as gorgeous as a movie star. This change in your outer self is due to transformations taking place within. You've probably been releasing a lot of old traumas from the past, and therefore considerable stress and tension have vanished from your face. Treat yourself to some new clothes. It's a great time to do it!",2,taurus,2018
1,"There is such a thing as being too honest, Taurus. You've experienced in the past how your determination to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth can cause hurt feelings. Today try to exercise a bit of tact and diplomacy. You will still be able to get your point across, with the added bonus that your audience will still be speaking to you once you've done so.",3,taurus,2018
2,"You tend to be your own worst critic, Taurus, and today you're more likely to be that way. Recent setbacks on the job might find you harboring doubts about your own capabilities. Be objective about the situation. Whatever happened was probably above and beyond your control, so it isn't fair to doubt yourself because of it. Work hard, continue to do the best you can, and don't let outside events sap your belief in yourself.",3,taurus,2018
3,"There could be a bit of confusion in your world today, Taurus. Trying to make sense of what's going on might not be the easiest task. Rational thinking and analytical processes may not be the best way to find the solution. You might be better off just letting the issue sit for now and deal with it later when the facts are clearer. Let go of control and the desire to make sense of it all. Instead, just relax and let the day take you where it will.",3,taurus,2018
4,"Your health has been glowing over the past few weeks, Taurus, but today you're likely to feel a little under the weather. This is probably due to nothing more exotic than stress. You've been working hard and concentrating on little else, so your body is now rebelling. You need some rest. Take time off and relax a little, and don't feel guilty about it. Even the President needs alone time occasionally.",3,taurus,2018
5,"As the world economy continues to boom, Taurus, don't be surprised if you're surrounded by new work possibilities. More than one chance to increase your income could come your way today. The problem will be wading through all these opportunities and trying to decide which is the most appealing and workable for you. List your options and outline the pros and cons of each. Writing things down can sometimes make them clearer.",3,taurus,2018
6,"There may be a stalemate when you're unwilling to express your feelings, Taurus. You might automatically assume that things will go smoothly if you leave the decisions up to someone else. Unfortunately, that plan will likely backfire if the decision is made by someone who doesn't necessarily have your best interests at heart. You may try to go back and reverse what has been done, thus fouling up the plan that has been set in motion.",3,taurus,2018
7,"You could find the hardest person to face is you, Taurus. You tend toward introspection, and you may find yourself shrinking into self-recrimination. You could analyze the important people in your life and yet fail to address the one you really need to look at – you. As you continually strive for perfection, give yourself proper credit. Do something nice for yourself today.",3,taurus,2018
8,"You may be on a slow, steady track of discipline that embraces an older, more traditional way of looking at things, Taurus. Suddenly, however, you're hit by an aggressive force urging you to do things differently. The more you try to resist this force, the more it's apt to cause friction and tension. Open your arms and welcome this new energy that will have a very positive effect on you.",3,taurus,2018
9,"An evening at home with your sweetheart could seem very appealing today, Taurus. Sex and romance are very much on your mind, and you might surprise yourself with how Earthy you feel. You could decide to pick up a romantic novel or see a sexy movie. You could learn to communicate better with your partner today, both verbally and physically. Make sure you look your best, and go for it!",3,taurus,2018
10,"Take action to create a fanciful dream world today, Taurus. Indeed, many of the activities of the day will be touched with an air of otherworldliness. Even though you generally like to keep your feet on the ground, realize that once in a while it's essential to let go and experience other realms of thought in order to gain new perspective. Let your hair down and go wild tonight.",3,taurus,2018
11,"You're sailing along and suddenly see a big ramp in front of you, Taurus. Your choice: avoid the ramp, stay on the ground where you know it's safe, and be content with a limited worldview, or hit that ramp head on and soar over the trees and beyond. Who knows where you might land? There is an incredible adventure waiting for you when you take that leap into the unknown.",3,taurus,2018
12,"Make sure that you're living consciously at this time, Taurus. It could be that you're going through a period of denial and simply refusing to see the truth of the situation. Open up your eyes to the world around you so you can invite in joy and compassion. Don't be satisfied with superficial interactions that don't really satisfy you emotionally and intellectually.",3,taurus,2018
13,"Put an extra spring in your step, Taurus. The slow, steady pace may be something that you're comfortable with, but note that the situations of the day call for something much more dynamic and brave. Pull out your leadership hat and put it on proudly. Today is the day for you to call the shots, instead of compromising in order to get along with others.",3,taurus,2018
14,"Optimism and enthusiasm for the months ahead have you feeling confident and strong. The sky's the limit! A male visitor could have some surprising news for you. This is a great day to make investments or purchase property. If you've been expecting money through legal papers or contracts, it could come in the mail today. The night could bring vivid and interesting dreams. In all, it's a thoroughly satisfying day.",3,taurus,2018
15,"Yes, you can be proud of yourself, Taurus. You really know your stuff. You have committed yourself to deepening your knowledge and capabilities and it really shows. Friends and family members will be coming to you for advice, and rightfully so. Try not to grow complacent, though. It's an easy trap to fall into. You'll need to continue full-speed ahead on your educational journey in order to keep that edge!",3,taurus,2018
16,"A project that you've worked on for a long time could bring some money your way, Taurus. Don't be too disappointed if you don't have it in your hands today. There might be a short delay of some kind, perhaps due to problems with the mail service. You might be turning your thoughts now to new projects. While you have a lot of ideas, you aren't likely to make firm decisions today.",3,taurus,2018
17,"Go ahead and make a list today, Taurus. Powerful emotions are likely to lure you from your current path unless you have some sort of concrete plan to fall back on. Put idle hands to use by delegating tasks to the people around you. You'll be amazed at the little blocks of time you have when you stay on task and keep yourself and everyone else around you in motion.",3,taurus,2018
18,"A creative project, perhaps one that could earn you some money, might well be the primary focus of your attention today. Perhaps you've been doing some writing or intend to teach a class. You might want to give the idea some thought, Taurus, if you haven't already. Your physical and mental energies are high. Success is strongly indicated if you start the ball rolling.",3,taurus,2018
19,"Let your emotions play with your imagination today, and feel free to discuss your findings openly with others, Taurus. Don't get caught up in so rational a frame of mind that you refuse to acknowledge any other way of viewing a current situation. Put away your analytical side in order to disclose a more abstract, intuitive perspective. Exercise that part of your brain that doesn't normally get used.",3,taurus,2018
20,"A temporary separation from someone close to you could have you reflecting on the good times you've spent together, especially over the past few weeks. You're likely to talk with him or her on the phone. You're feeling a lot of warmth and affection toward everyone around you, but a little sad as well, particularly when you think of those far away. Call them up, Taurus! They'll be glad to hear from you.",3,taurus,2018
21,"Visitors could come to your home tonight, Taurus, possibly for an informal get-together of some kind. Dear friends might be involved in some way. You're likely to be very busy during the day, perhaps tying up loose ends. Your mind is probably going a thousand miles an hour, so you'll need to wind down before going to bed tonight. You don't want to lose any sleep.",3,taurus,2018
22,"You may start the day feeling a little insecure about everything going on around you, Taurus. The increased pressures of work might have strained your nerves a little. However, a lot of love and attention from friends, children, and the special person in your life should have you feeling better about everything in no time. In the evening, relax and watch a video with your mate!",3,taurus,2018
23,"Work on your own projects may be very much on your mind today, Taurus. They could involve studies of some kind or the arts. It's possible that you may be considering innovative ways of earning extra money. All signs indicate that any enterprise begun or continued today is likely to succeed, so go to it. However, it's important to give whatever you're working on a lot of thought before presenting it to others.",3,taurus,2018
24,"An important lost object, perhaps a paper of some kind, could command the attention of your entire household, Taurus. This could prove frustrating at first, because you will know that it has to be somewhere in the house, but you can't find it anywhere! The item may reappear just as you've given up on it, in a place you never would have imagined! Tip: it's probably hidden among other objects.",3,taurus,2018
25,"If you've been thinking about taking a trip, Taurus, this isn't the day to make plans. Whatever you learn today about airline schedules or hotels may not reflect the situation as it really is. If you wait a few days, things should go far more smoothly. If you already have plans to leave, expect some delays. Don't let them put you in a gloomy state of mind! Make up your mind to have fun!",3,taurus,2018
26,"Study of intellectual or spiritual subjects that particularly interest you could keep you at home for much of the day, Taurus. More than one visitor might drop by in order to discuss these matters, perhaps bringing a few books. Discussions could take on an imaginative, idealistic, and even mystical level, which could prove inspiring for all involved. Take notes, because you'll want to be sure and remember these conversations.",3,taurus,2018
27,"You may be asked to swallow your pride and give in to someone else's will today, Taurus. This will be difficult for you to do. Try to concentrate on your good reasons for obedience, and work out your frustration by taking a brisk walk. Expect to receive some welcome news from another source, which will also help calm you down. Relax with a group of supportive friends tonight.",3,taurus,2018
28,"You could spend much of your day advancing the interests of an organization dedicated to a cause that means a lot to you, Taurus, perhaps in animal or children's rights. You tend to be service oriented by nature, and today something you learn, perhaps from TV or the Internet, could excite your desire to make a difference to those you wish to serve. Expect to derive a lot of satisfaction from this. You're making a difference!",3,taurus,2018
29,"Have you been thinking about taking a course in one of the arts, Taurus? Whether your preference is painting, music, drama, dance, or creative writing, if you commit now, you'll probably continue with it. The practical arts of cooking, building, or interior decoration are also possibilities. Whatever it is, it won't be quickly abandoned. If you begin with the idea of eventually doing it professionally, chances are you will. Good luck!",3,taurus,2018
30,"Are things really going this beautifully for you, Taurus? This is a question you might ask yourself now. All looks perfect as career, romance, education, and spiritual matters seem to crystallize into a wonderful life. Don't waste time worrying if this is all too good to be true! You're concerned about the future, but right now, live in the moment. You're creating some great memories, if nothing else. Enjoy!",3,taurus,2018
31,"A financial goal you've been hoping to reach very soon might seem right around the corner, Taurus, but there still seem to be a thousand things you have to do before it's actually realized. This could get you down temporarily, but don't get stuck there. Make a list of whatever needs to be done and then tackle each task one at a time until the goal is reached. Get busy!",3,taurus,2018
1,"Today's planetary configuration will give you a strong urge to be out and about, Taurus, but responsibilities could keep you at home or the office. Perhaps you're waiting for a delivery or an important phone call or visitor. This could be boring and rather tedious for you today. Find something to do that engrosses you, even if it's only reading or catching up on paperwork. There's no point in just twiddling your thumbs!",4,taurus,2018
2,"It could be difficult for you to think straight today, Taurus. Your brain is probably working in short, erratic bursts that keep you guessing about which way to proceed. Avoid confusion during the day by periodically centering and separating yourself and your feelings from the drama around you. Don't pretend you understand something if you don't. If a situation doesn't make sense, go ahead and question it.",4,taurus,2018
3,"Your attitude is calm and matter-of-fact when talking to others, Taurus. You tell it like it is while omitting the frills and fantasies. You have no reason to hide the truth, so you're happy to disclose information to any willing listener. Be careful, because you could get into someone else's private business uninvited. If you hear some secret information, you could tell it to others who definitely shouldn't hear it.",4,taurus,2018
4,"Take care of your friends by supporting their ideas, Taurus. Be careful that you don't automatically encourage a plan or viewpoint that you know is wrong or doomed to fail. Even though you might want to make them feel good by saying exactly what they want to hear, this isn't really doing them any favors. People come up with some wild schemes, so it's important to bring a levelheaded perspective to the table.",4,taurus,2018
5,"If you have children, Taurus, you could be feeling a bit overworked and overwhelmed. If you don't have children, perhaps the constraints and demands of your professional life are weighing heavily on your mind. Don't worry - these feelings shall pass. Expect an opportunity to get free of the ties that bind. Even though it will only be a temporary respite, take advantage of it!",4,taurus,2018
6,"Today isn't a day for meditation, Taurus. The planetary energies are asking you to step outside of yourself and get back into the world again! You've been doing an awful lot of thinking about your image recently, and now you're going to have to test out how the ""new and improved"" you operates in your daily life. You can expect some pleasant feedback and truly lasting changes!",4,taurus,2018
7,"A rather disconcerting rumor about your job could reach your ears, Taurus. Perhaps you'll hear that the company is being sold or undergoing a shakeup in the hierarchy. You might get caught up in a frenzy of worry about whether or not you'll stay on. Before jumping to any conclusions, phone someone who knows what's going on and find out the truth. What you've heard is probably just gossip.",4,taurus,2018
8,"Paperwork involving money needs to be executed today, Taurus. It could be a settlement, new commission, or bonus of some kind. This is likely to be a joyous occasion because money is coming your way, even though the paperwork itself might be a drag. Try to concentrate and get it done quickly so you and those close to you can go out and celebrate. Make a reservation at your favorite restaurant.",4,taurus,2018
9,"Today you could look in the mirror and panic about your appearance, Taurus. You might be feeling a little under the weather and look a little tired. Nonetheless, you probably look a lot better than you think you do. Don't fall into the trap of blowing every little flaw out of proportion. A little rest is probably all you need in order to look like yourself again.",4,taurus,2018
10,"Today you could feel full of energy and eager to get out for some exercise, Taurus, but other responsibilities might threaten to keep you from doing it. The resulting frustration could zap all your energy and put you in a lethargic mood. Don't fall into this trap! Get the most urgent tasks done and then get the exercise you need. This way, you can recoup both your physical and mental energy.",4,taurus,2018
11,"Ingenuity blossoms when you make the effort to do a little writing, Taurus, perhaps technical manuals or other professionally oriented projects. This could represent a new stage in your professional life. You're apt to do well and attract considerable attention from higher-ups. Don't get too caught up in the need to revise, edit, then revise and edit again. It will only take up time, and it's possible to do too much rewriting.",4,taurus,2018
12,"You should be feeling physically strong, healthy, and energetic today, Taurus, although you could also be a little lightheaded. You could experience the sensation of wandering around in a daze with your feet on the ground and your head in the clouds. Achieving balance won't be easy, but you should be able to manage it today. Concentrate on activities that involve spiritual or imaginative faculties today.",4,taurus,2018
13,"You like to feel needed, Taurus, but today you might throw up your hands and say, ""Enough!"" You've given so much of yourself for so long that friends and loved ones tend to think of your largesse as a right rather than a privilege. Today, remind them of their error. Take a day off from indentured servitude. Go to a fancy restaurant and enjoy being waited on. Don't forget to leave a big tip.",4,taurus,2018
14,"A warm, loving phone call or letter could come your way today from a lover or close friend who's presently out of town. You'll wish with all your heart that he or she could be home! In the meantime, you're likely to keep yourself quite busy, Taurus. Creative projects, activities in your community, or both could keep you too busy to miss anyone too much. Tonight, spend some time alone.",4,taurus,2018
15,"It's hard to imagine a world without computers, Taurus. Technology has been key to your professional life, and it's likely to be even more important in the future. Expect your income to increase dramatically this year as a result of a technological innovation. You could play a part in developing it, or more likely, find a creative use for it. Eat well and rest up, because you'll need a lot of energy soon.",4,taurus,2018
16,"OK, up and at 'em, Taurus! You might feel like you're walking through sand today, but you really need to shake your booty and get the blood flowing. If you don't get up and do something, you'll be a slug all day. You need to clear your head and cast off that bloated feeling. Most importantly, you want to get a good start to the day so you can accomplish everything that awaits you.",4,taurus,2018
17,"This could be a day of technical glitches and malfunctions, Taurus. It's frustrating, to be sure, but a little bit funny, too. Everything you touch, from computer to washing machine, seems to groan and shudder before finally breaking. Apparently, today you have the opposite of the Midas touch. Don't take it personally. Instead, use it as an excuse to do something out of the ordinary with your time.",4,taurus,2018
18,"This is a good day for you to analyze information, Taurus. You have an especially acute business sense, which you should use to your advantage. Whether you're thinking of translating a creative project into a business proposal or working on that business plan, all indications say that your efforts will yield rich rewards. Make the most of whatever this day has to offer.",4,taurus,2018
19,"You may be in a quiet, reflective mood today, Taurus. You could receive a communication from an old friend that sets you remembering the good old days of your youth. You can't help but look at some of your pivotal decisions and wonder how your life would have been different had you made other choices. It's pointless to play that game. Don't wonder about ""what if.” Embrace what you have.",4,taurus,2018
20,"Be careful of people who talk a great deal and promise the world but have a difficult time delivering the goods, Taurus. You might get trapped today if you rely on people who simply don't come through the way they said they would. Feel free to engage in social activities with partners, but don't sign any major business deals with them at this time.",4,taurus,2018
21,"A friend or neighbor you need to contact could be in and out all day, Taurus, and so you could have trouble reaching him or her. Phone or email probably won't work, since your friend could be too busy to check messages. The best way to make contact might be to hop in the car and drive to wherever they might be. Take the side streets, however. The main roads are probably clogged with traffic!",4,taurus,2018
22,"Have you been reading about how a positive mental outlook creates a healthy body and a happy life, Taurus? If so, you might just find that this attitude brings results. You're feeling strong, fit, and mentally sharp. Career interests seem to be looking up for you. A fringe benefit is that you're probably feeling especially intuitive, too. Keep doing whatever you've been doing to bring this all about, because it's working!",4,taurus,2018
23,"If you're single, Taurus, tonight you could find yourself longing for a lover from the past and wondering what's happening with this person right now. If you're currently involved, you might be experiencing a temporary separation from your beloved, and could feel inclined to spend the evening at home. If you choose to do this, entertain yourself with a favorite book or movie. Remember - a watched phone never rings!",4,taurus,2018
24,"This is a day to stay close to home and organize the house. You might be thinking how you can best utilize your living space. It's clear that some improvements are in order, Taurus. Perhaps you could begin by tackling all those minor repairs that you've been putting off. Once those are done, a fresh coat of paint will do wonders to brighten both your home and your outlook.",4,taurus,2018
25,"It's time to refill the well of your soul, Taurus. You spend so much of your life in service to others that it's only natural that you feel drained sometimes. Rather than try to push past this feeling and go on as though nothing is the matter, consider it a sign that something is amiss. Admit if you're feeling unappreciated. You've spent too much time putting the happiness of others before your own. It's time to change your priorities.",4,taurus,2018
26,"You're interested in better understanding yourself and your reactions to the world around you. Well, Taurus, today you should take the time to look over your successes and failures, especially where your family life is concerned. The atmosphere is changing and things will be much more positive over the next few days. Think about sharing with other people what you have learned.",4,taurus,2018
27,"Be sure to answer all phone calls and open all letters and emails today, Taurus. You're likely to receive some interesting news. You might get word from a former boss that you'd be perfect for a new position opening up in his or her office. Or perhaps an old lover makes tentative inquiries about renewing old bonds. Your eyebrows will rise in surprise at least once during this day. Expect the unexpected!",4,taurus,2018
28,"Some blatantly untrue gossip could reach you today, Taurus. When you think about it, you'll see that what you heard defies all logic and is actually rather ludicrous. However, the person who reports it to you could be so dynamic and persuasive that you believe it for a little while. Remember to check the facts in such situations. You'll stay grounded in reality rather than get caught up in fantasy.",4,taurus,2018
29,"Career matters should be going very well for you today, Taurus. A sudden change regarding your work could catapult you into a position you've been hoping to reach for a long time. A rise in income could result. You've worked hard and done very well, so what may seem a lucky break to others is actually the result of intense, determined effort on your part. Enjoy your success and make the most of it.",4,taurus,2018
30,"You might pick up some rather disturbing thoughts from a friend, neighbor, or relative, Taurus. This person could be upset over something and not communicating his or her feelings. It isn't appropriate to try to coax this person into sharing with you now. They aren't upset with you, but they might be if you push! Back off and let this person come to terms with the problem. Your friend will talk the time is right.",4,taurus,2018
1,"You seem to want to become old and wise before your time, Taurus. Today's aspects will take you by the hand and lead you back into the heat of the action, experiencing life in all its intensity. Yes, we know you're really afraid of all this. But if you don't get back into action, you'll stay alone in your little corner. The world needs you. Don't stay at home!",5,taurus,2018
2,"The astral energy is encouraging you to open up more to your world, culture, and ways of thinking, Taurus. You don't have to go off alone in the desert to reinvent everything. For you, this would be the easy way out, because it would allow you to hide! Develop your curiosity about what exists in this society. Your opinion will carry weight later on.",5,taurus,2018
3,"You may feel like you're being left out of the equation, Taurus. Perhaps you feel like the oddball, the fifth wheel who simply doesn't have a place. Don't worry. Just because you feel that way today doesn't mean it's your destiny. If you don't like your course, change your position. If you don't like the people you're with, move in a different social circle. Don't blame your circumstances on others. Take responsibility.",5,taurus,2018
4,"You are particularly inspired by and sensitive to crisis situations. What that means is that you can't stand to see other people suffer. Sometimes even you suffer because you don't allow yourself to do the things you like best and the things that help you feel fulfilled as a person. Why don't you think about going easier on yourself, just for today? Try it - you might like it!",5,taurus,2018
5,"Today you might find that a long-term dream finally comes true. Perhaps a trip that you've fantasized about for a long time finally shows promise of actually happening, Taurus. A practical and methodical approach to arranging the details should make it seem that much more real to you. However, do take care to plan each step carefully so that you don't end up working harder than necessary.",5,taurus,2018
6,"Invitations to attend social events, perhaps business related, could bring surprising results, Taurus. You might meet more than one person who shares some of your interests, and these people could become friends. Expect some interesting practical and philosophical discussions. An opportunity to travel abroad or to a distant state might open up for you. This could prove to be a most exciting and stimulating day. Make the most of it!",5,taurus,2018
7,"You may feel indecisive, insecure, and stuck in the middle of a difficult situation, Taurus. Your energy could be drawn in one direction while your self-confidence is pulled in another. This dilemma has to do with your inability to integrate different aspects of your life that you try to keep separate. Try to look at things in terms of the whole. Notice how your actions in one part of your life have a ripple effect everywhere else.",5,taurus,2018
8,"Your warm, loving, romantic nature is noticed whether you realize it or not, Taurus. Perhaps you sometimes feel like there isn't enough excitement in your life - especially your love life. Don't think this means you need to change in order to please others. Your stable, quiet nature is comforting to those who understand and appreciate it. The last thing you want to do today is pretend to be someone you aren't.",5,taurus,2018
9,"It's time to elevate your sense of self, Taurus. You're just as good as anyone else, so why don't you believe it? The problem is that you're very sensitive about having an ego. Even though you know everyone does, you punish yourself for its existence! This is a noble idea, but it doesn't do you any good. You'll never be perfect and neither will anyone else. What are you worrying about?",5,taurus,2018
10,"No one dislikes red tape and bureaucracy more than you. But take advantage of the atmosphere today. If you have any applications to submit or formalities to complete, you'll find the process much easier than usual. Communication channels that are normally closed will open, and the administrative mechanisms will be well oiled instead of grinding. Get all administrative tasks done so you won't have to think about them again!",5,taurus,2018
11,"You can expect today to be tense, Taurus, as the people close to you are likely to be especially irritable. Adults and children alike may throw tantrums for no reason, and you'll be criticized for having overlooked some small detail. Fortunately, your new awareness helps you realize that you aren't obligated to do anyone any favors. In this new role, you're able to express your discontent with a quiet, calm authority.",5,taurus,2018
12,"Here is a day of challenges, Taurus. You're a pro at questioning yourself, as you'll prove today when you take a hard look at your accomplishments. What have you created of a personal nature in the last ten years? Have you followed someone else's example because you doubted yourself? Have you been eternally “almost” ready? Have you dared to jump into projects that were still imperfect? These are the questions that need to be addressed.",5,taurus,2018
13,"A group might invite you to participate in a creative project of some kind today, Taurus. Whatever you do is likely to be stimulating and exciting. You'll want to channel a lot of energy and enthusiasm into it. You could find yourself thinking in terms of a partnership, making plans to explore the possibility further. This is a great day for socializing. If you receive an invitation to go out, go!",5,taurus,2018
14,Today's planetary energy should compel you to commit certain acts of self-affirmation that are needed to define your territory and protect your rights. You'll be encouraged to explore your desires and personal tastes and express your opinion openly and clearly. Everyone has an identity to claim! Don't be bashful about claiming yours now.,5,taurus,2018
15,"The good news is it can only get better. For today, however, there may be some trying times in store, Taurus. If you're a parent, the children will beg for something every five minutes. At work, you'll feel pressure from all sides. Not even your love life is immune from the doubt that seems to hover over you. No compromise is possible today. Just sit tight and know that calmer days are coming.",5,taurus,2018
16,"The great period of meditation that started for you a few weeks ago is now finished, Taurus. This means that you are going to have to get back into the real world again! You are going to have to test out how the ""new and improved"" you operates in everyday life. Get ready. You can expect some real changes!",5,taurus,2018
17,"It may be difficult to express yourself fully today, Taurus. Somehow the words aren't coming out quite as clearly as you'd like. Powerful emotions are getting in the way. It could be difficult for you to find solid footing on such a muddy surface. Don't try to confine yourself to one way of doing something. Patience is a key virtue now. Wait until things clear before you proceed.",5,taurus,2018
18,"There are moments when your powers of clear thinking reveal the tremendous amount of maturity that you have, Taurus. You aren't usually a dreamer, so it's rather difficult to lead you into ambiguous situations. If you currently have sentimental affairs going on in your life, this would be an excellent day to take stock. But try not to be too cold-hearted.",5,taurus,2018
19,"Do you think your body reflects who you are, Taurus? If you have the feeling that it doesn't, it's probably because the image you have of yourself isn't quite right. Take a close look at yourself in order to readjust that image. You'll see that your body is the exact mirror of who you are at the moment. The alignment of the planets will help you see this more clearly now.",5,taurus,2018
20,"Just when you're feeling good and solid in your plan, Taurus, something or someone may step in to rain on your parade. You could get the feeling today that you're taking one step forward and two steps back. Perhaps there's a feeling of doubt creeping into the picture. Try not to let these nagging, restrictive energies hold you back. Be confident about your abilities.",5,taurus,2018
21,"Your mood should be quite good today, Taurus, and you'll be well supported by the people around you. The key is to bring intense feelings directly to the table as you experience them. You'll find that other people share similar emotions at this time. The combination of energies between you and those close to you is simply magical. Join together with others on elaborate projects and special events.",5,taurus,2018
22,"This could be a good day to try relaxation techniques that are a little bit out of the ordinary. Who knows? Maybe you'll even learn something from these unorthodox methods. Why not explore shiatsu or polarity? These techniques can do wonders for restoring your energy, an element that has been in short supply for you lately. Give it a try. As the good doctor said, ""This won't hurt a bit.""",5,taurus,2018
23,"You can cut through to the truth quite easily today, Taurus, so don't hesitate to do so. If you come to an intersection and no one seems to know who should go next, take the initiative and go. It might not be a bad idea to signal your intentions to the other drivers before you make your move. Being aggressive with your actions doesn't mean you have to be reckless.",5,taurus,2018
24,"Attend to your duties today, Taurus. There's a pronounced sense of the passage of time and feeling that the days are slipping quickly by. Make sure you fit love and romance somewhere into the equation. You may experience a bit of resistance in this department at first, but that indicates that this is an area you need to explore and ultimately feel more comfortable with.",5,taurus,2018
25,"You're filled with vitality today, Taurus. In other words, you're going to feel great about yourself! You're less afraid of meeting people, and you have fewer doubts about everything, including yourself!

That way, you can recreate the feeling tomorrow.",5,taurus,2018

Are you prepared for the challenge? Whether you're ready or not, it's here. Remember the importance of individuality. Don't become another typical cookie from the same old cookie cutter. Be your own person and think for yourself.",5,taurus,2018
27,"It's time to review your dreams and fantasies, Taurus. It could be that you've been neglecting them lately. Perhaps things you've been working toward haven't exactly panned out the way you'd hoped. The good news is that things should be turning around in your favor starting today. Take control of your dreams and you'll find that you can get them moving forward again.",5,taurus,2018

You'll win a great number of loyal friends to your side as you share your passionate nature with others.",5,taurus,2018
29,"The last months have been very challenging - and there's a very good chance that you no longer feel up to meeting the challenges.
If you've been yearning to modify something in your daily life, do it now, Taurus. The hour has come to make concrete changes. Regardless of whether the change you seek is at home or work, physical or emotional, don't be afraid to seriously upset your life.",5,taurus,2018
30,"This is a good day for you to get out of the dirt and into the air in order to gain a fresh, new perspective on a situation, Taurus. Don't dwell on things beneath or behind you. Keep looking up. Pick up the phone and call a close friend you haven't spoken with in a while. There may be a great deal of catching up to do. Sometimes we forget the importance of maintaining contact with old buddies.",5,taurus,2018
31,"If you wake up this morning and want nothing more than to stay under the sheets and cuddle a little longer, know that you aren't alone, Taurus. There is a sensitive warmth about the day that's making you feel vulnerable. Make sure to surround yourself with supportive people today. Harsh words are likely to cut more deeply than usual, making you wish you'd just stayed in bed all day.",5,taurus,2018
1,"Your emotions will feel stable today, Taurus, although there may be an unexpected element trying to sneak into the equation. Be aware that people will be a bit more volatile today. Although the situation may be calm and cool one minute, it has the potential to be explosive the next. Try to stay centered all day so you don't get thrown off course by other people's erratic emotions.",6,taurus,2018
2,"If you've considered a career in publishing, Taurus, this is the time to go for it. It's also a great day to enroll in law school, an advanced degree program, or any field of higher education.

3,"Today you might feel the need to be of service to others. Your humanitarian instincts are high, Taurus, though you might tend to over-idealize the concept a little. It's wonderful to help those less fortunate, but often the process involves a heavy commitment of time and energy. If you decide to do this, it could transform your life in a profound way. Be prepared for some pretty heavy changes.",6,taurus,2018
4,"Today you might need to execute some paperwork regarding money, Taurus. Bills might need to be paid, deposits made, or checks collected. Minor incidents could interrupt you, causing some frustration. Communication of all kinds, including those with people close to you, might go awry during the day. It doesn't change the positive turn your life is taking. Keep at it.",6,taurus,2018
5,"Although you've been feeling especially strong physically over the past few days, Taurus, today you might feel a little under the weather. You could even experience some giddiness. This is nothing to worry about, but you should try to take it easy. Don't exercise if you don't feel up to it. Get some rest. Even if you have to postpone some chores, you'll be better off in the long run.",6,taurus,2018
6,"The desire to acquire more knowledge is front and center today, Taurus. A lecture or workshop might lead to plans for a vacation of some kind with friends or other members of a group you're affiliated with. Family members might also show an interest. You could all review the possibilities together and jot ideas. The energy and enthusiasm of everyone around you is high, so make the most of their ideas.",6,taurus,2018
7,"Shared activities throughout the day could bring you closer to a friend or lover, Taurus. You might attend a sports event, lecture or workshop, or concert or play.

8,"Long-buried emotions from the past, some of them pleasant and some in need of release, could well up from your subconscious today, Taurus. This is likely to have an uplifting effect on your mental and emotional state, so don't fight it. It's also likely to release whatever hang-ups you might have about relationships. Therefore, you can expect all your involvements to thrive - particularly the romantic ones. Enjoy.",6,taurus,2018
9,"Every once in a while everyone must analyze his or her life. But you tend to be too pessimistic when you ponder yours. You get easily carried away, and you often exaggerate. Today, as you think about your life, try not to listen to that little voice in your head. Your life is far from being the way that you think it is.",6,taurus,2018
10,"That little child you once were and that you're trying so desperately to forget is still causing you problems, Taurus. Why do you try so hard to deny that sweet and tender part of you that comes out even in your adult life? You'll forget about your faults, imperfections, and complexes more easily if you just remember your childhood fondly, and maybe even smile about it.",6,taurus,2018
11,"You shouldn't try to fight the feelings that run through you today. Don't even try to rationalize them. These feelings are probably related to emotions dating back to your childhood. You shouldn't avoid or analyze them. There will be a lot of turmoil welling up inside you, Taurus. You should try to find some peace and quiet in the arms of a special someone.",6,taurus,2018
12,"A get-together with a group of your closest friends could bring about some intense communication, with many revealing some of your deepest concerns, Taurus.

This could well bring all of you closer together and increase future contact. Enjoy your day!",6,taurus,2018
13,"A group with which you're affiliated with could suddenly seem to grow closer, and a family feeling could develop among its members.

You'll be able to learn a lot about your motivations and the keys to your success.",6,taurus,2018
16,"A group you're affiliated with could meet today, perhaps in your neighborhood, Taurus. You should focus more on listening to what they have to say than on actively participating in discussions.

Your mind is both intuitive and logical, so expect to learn a lot.",6,taurus,2018
17,"Matters involving creativity, romance, and children could require considerable thought today, Taurus. Some exciting new options may be available to you and your loved ones.

You also wonder where you fit in.",6,taurus,2018
21,"Stress from overwork could have you feeling weaker than usual. You might be tempted to stay at home, get some rest, and recoup your energies. Do this if you can, Taurus.

If you feel you can't stay home, try to work alone so you won't be distracted.",6,taurus,2018
22,"This is a good day to stand up for yourself and make it known that you aren't a pushover, Taurus. Use the powerful energy of the day to follow through on projects that may have lost momentum.

Trust your instincts and move in that direction. Don't hesitate.",6,taurus,2018
25,"Success on all levels is filling your life and making you feel absolutely wonderful, Taurus. The downside of this is that you might be a little too conscientious.

Make sure you aren't thrown off course by other people's whims.",6,taurus,2018
1,"A good tip for you to remember is to be careful about what you say about others, Taurus. If you're talking about someone who isn't present, act as if he or she is.

People could lose trust in you.",7,taurus,2018

You're responsible for your feelings and no one else's.",7,taurus,2018
5,"You may have found yourself having some issues with food lately, Taurus. It could be that your sense of self-worth isn't at its highest and you're trying to make up for it by sabotaging your relationship with your body.

Time is precious - don't waste it.",7,taurus,2018
10,"Come out of serious mode for a day and let yourself laugh, Taurus. Sponsor a game night at your home and invite some good friends over to play cards and nibble on snacks until midnight.

11,"This is a great day to develop any latent talents you've wanted to explore, Taurus, particularly those involving the arts. You might want to try working with friends who have the same talent.

12,"It may be difficult to stay grounded today with all the information flying around and the emotions roiling in your heart. Try not to take things too seriously, Taurus.

There will be plenty of time to catch up on work.",7,taurus,2018
18,"New communications equipment may make whatever work you do that much easier to do, Taurus. You might have some doubts about your ability to use it, but don't worry.

Go to it!",7,taurus,2018
19,"You may be in an especially nurturing mood today, Taurus. You might reach out to every living thing around you, from plants to pets to friends, children, and romantic partners.

Get some perspective.",7,taurus,2018

29,You'll find that your brain is extra sharp today and you have a greater sense of clarity regarding your purpose in life. It could be that your nurturing instinct is high and your general self-esteem depends on how useful you can be to the people around you.

There is a special gleam in your smile today that you should share openly with others. Don't feel rushed to get anywhere. You have already arrived. Enjoy yourself in the company of those you love.",12,gemini,2017
31,"Today you might learn something about a friend that could be rather disconcerting, Gemini. There could be a dark side to this person that you weren't previously aware of, and this could cause you to want to withdraw for a while and reevaluate your involvement with this individual. When considering it, remember that we all have our dark sides. Could what you've discovered simply be this factor, or does this go too far beyond it for you? Think about it!",12,gemini,2017
1,"Your energy and enthusiasm for life should be operating at a very high level today, Gemini. You may therefore want to get together with some of your friends, and might even organize an impromptu social event of some kind. Exciting news and stimulating conversation should keep your mind busy for a long time. At some point you'll want to work off some of that physical energy, perhaps by taking a brisk walk or another kind of workout. Enjoy your day.",1,gemini,2018
2,"Even though you might have to work today, Gemini, you should still try and take things fairly easy. You're just not ready to embrace your workload with your usual vigor. Be sure to eat a healthy breakfast and lunch, as your body may be rebelling from some recent indulgences. Soup and a salad are advisable for lunch, along with plenty of water. By day's end, you will feel your energy begin to return.",1,gemini,2018
3,"This is a day when you could greatly benefit from spending some time outdoors in quiet reflection, Gemini. Even a half-hour's walk through a city park will help you feel more rested and grounded. You have been working especially hard lately, and need some time to refill the well of your soul. Don't deny yourself some downtime. Otherwise, you're at risk of burning out.",1,gemini,2018
4,"Finally, all of your efforts are being recognized, Gemini. That's not to say that you can now sit back and rest on your laurels - quite the contrary! Now is the time to put your original ideas to the test. But this time you have the backing of the higher-ups. Don't be nervous; just do what you had planned to do all along. If you work hard, you're likely to see tremendous professional and financial rewards.",1,gemini,2018
5,"A member of your household may be having troubles, Gemini, and therefore you might consider staying home from work in order to help them get through it all. Nonetheless, you have career responsibilities that you need to fulfill. Whether to stay home or go to work may be a difficult decision to make today, but be sure you weigh all possible factors. Probably your housemate will insist that all is well and send you to work.",1,gemini,2018
6,"Writing may be one of your main focuses for today, Gemini. You have a lot of information to impart to anyone who might be interested in what you have to say. You could try your hand at a magazine article or perhaps fiction or poetry. However, even if all you write at this time is a letter to your cousin, what you say will undoubtedly be bright, gripping, and certainly very interesting. Go to it!",1,gemini,2018
7,"There is no question about it, Gemini, change is in the air! Perhaps you can't feel it because you have allowed yourself to become bogged down in disappointment. You can't help but wonder if you will ever attain your goals. Well, take heart. The times they are a'changing, as Bob Dylan says. You just need to wait a bit longer. In the end, it doesn't matter how long it took to get there, only that you arrived!",1,gemini,2018
8,"Right now you might be in the process of moving from one job to another, Gemini. This might even be a total change in career. Your hard work is paying off, though it may not show up in your bank account for a while yet. There might be contracts to be executed first. Your social life may be put on hold until all facets of this transition are worked out. Don't be intimidated, however. You've made the right choice.",1,gemini,2018
9,"One disadvantage of attics is that so much junk tends to get stored up there. Today is the day for you to clean house. You've been putting this off long enough and now must face the dust and debris in your own personal attic. Whether it's emotional messes that need cleaning up or business matters that beg for attention, know that you will be hurting yourself and your future prospects if you delay any longer.",1,gemini,2018
10,"Overindulgence in food or drink could have you feeling a little under the weather today, Gemini. Therefore it will be difficult to focus on anything that needs your attention. Perhaps you just need to take it slowly so as to recoup your energy. Do just enough to keep your conscience clear, but don't wear yourself out. Get a good book, a cup of tea, then sit on the couch and relax.",1,gemini,2018
11,"Do you have plans to go to a party tonight, Gemini? Don't cancel them. If you're single, an exciting new potential love partner might be introduced to you, and you could spend the entire evening together. If you're already involved, someone could come on the scene who could prove a valuable business contact and might even form a partnership with you. Unless you're too tired to move, get up and go! You won't regret it!",1,gemini,2018
12,"Reflections on your recent success and good fortune with regard to career matters are likely to have you feeling strong, optimistic, and enthusiastic for the future, Gemini.

Enjoy your day, and treat yourself to an evening out.",1,gemini,2018
13,"Memories from the distant past, perhaps as far back as early childhood, could keep popping into your conscious mind today, Gemini. You may feel really silly, crying over a fairy tale your grandmother read to you when you were five years old, but as embarrassing as this can be, it's actually a positive form of release. Old pain from the past, even as inane as this, can actually limit you in your current situation. Let it go and learn from the process.",1,gemini,2018
14,"Today you could find yourself searching for a particular piece of knowledge that you need in order to move on with something you're doing, Gemini. You'll probably find it, perhaps through a friend or colleague. Or else it might show itself suddenly, making you want to shout, ""Eureka!"" After that, it's smooth sailing all the way. You'll be able to use this information to accomplish whatever you need and be successful. Make good use of it.",1,gemini,2018
15,"Inspiration stemming from other places and other cultures might direct your passions to a new creative project of some kind, Gemini. Your mind is quick and resourceful and your energy high, so you'll probably have a busy day. You could also be feeling especially romantic and sexy and desirous to share all you've been doing with a love partner. Arrange a hot date if you can, then make sure you look your best! Enjoy!",1,gemini,2018
16,"A partner or colleague might be going through some changes right now, causing you to wonder if you have a future with this person. It might appear that you're moving ahead while this person is lagging behind. This could be just a temporary condition, Gemini, so take care not to jump to any conclusions at this time. Offer your assistance and do what you can, then let the person work things out. This may pass in a few days.",1,gemini,2018
17,"Communication with others should be as strong on a psychic level as on a verbal one, so expect some telepathic flashes. Practicality and common sense combine with intuition today to make you feel especially creative. A number of ideas for new projects could cross your mind, Gemini, and you'll want to write them down for later. However, there might be so many that you won't be able to decide which one to go for now. Ask your friends for their input!",1,gemini,2018
18,"Your life circumstances may have altered so much in the past few months that you could be in an entirely different space than ever before, Gemini. Success and good fortune have increased your self-image, and business and money matters should be going well. Today you should pause to take some time to assess your situation and decide in which direction you want to go. You now have it in your power to make dreams come true.",1,gemini,2018
19,"If you have been having problems in your relationship or love life in general, Gemini, don't expect things to get any better today. The people around you might find you extremely irritable! It may seem that anything anyone says gets on your nerves. Even the sweet nothings that your sweetheart whispers in your ear seem like a bunch of hot air! But you will be forgiven for your irritability, and besides, not every day can be as passionate and loving as you'd like it to be.",1,gemini,2018
20,"Not only do you want to live life to the fullest every second, you also feel the need to leave your special mark on the world you live in. You just have to be creative in life, Gemini. You can't help it. That great project you've been thinking about for a while is just beginning to take shape. Today you may find some of the materials you needed to really get things going! A financial gift or the gift of someone's time? Someone's generosity could really make your day!",1,gemini,2018
21,"Your level of imagination and inspiration should be operating at a very high level today, Gemini, so if you've been planning to start a new artistic project, this is the day to do it. You're also likely to be feeling quite intuitive, so don't be surprised if you find yourself tuning acutely in to the thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires of others, even strangers. Your higher mind is very close to your conscious mind. Make the most of it!",1,gemini,2018
22,"A close friend or lover could share a secret with you today, Gemini. An older person could be in the news, perhaps an author or politician you particularly admire. You, yourself, could feel inspired to work on a creative project of some kind, although the downside might be that you keep working at it for too long and could well exhaust yourself. Remember to take breaks. You need to relax a little and remember to take time out to eat.",1,gemini,2018
23,"Today you might attend more than one group activity or social event involving spiritual or metaphysical matters. Your sense of intuition is very high, Gemini, and your level of understanding is especially acute. Therefore, concepts that could be confusing at other times could seem as clear as a bell today. You might form strong bonds with others who are also present, and you might make plans to meet with them again in the future. Enjoy!",1,gemini,2018
24,"It may be easy for you to show up at a party or answer the phone when you know that it's your best friend calling with good news, but where are you when the going gets rough, Gemini? Make sure you show your support to people in all situations. Don't be just a fair-weather friend. Your loyalty to others may be tested today when conflict arises and tempers get high.",1,gemini,2018
25,"A female visitor who might have a few problems might come to your door wanting advice and sympathy, Gemini. She could have some other news that could come as a shock to you. A crisis on the job might make it necessary for you or your partner to spend most of the time today away from home and family. This could be frustrating, particularly if you have to cancel your plans. Hang in there!",1,gemini,2018
26,"Relationships of all kinds should be thriving at this time, Gemini. Mind and emotions join together in a beneficial partnership, enabling you to increase your understanding of those close to you. Romantic involvements strengthen in particular, as an understanding of your partner's values, attitudes, and motivations becomes clearer to you. Make your new insights known to everyone around you, preferably in a subtle rather than verbal way. The latter might sound patronizing.",1,gemini,2018
27,"Let the genius within you come out and play, Gemini. You may feel like some sort of inventor who has wild ideas that could help to revolutionize the future. Bring these ideas into the open and see what kind of response you get from the people around you. Cutting-edge concepts are likely to appeal to you the most. These are the ones that you should pursue and follow through on if you can.",1,gemini,2018
28,"Long-distance phone calls from people living in distant states could bring some rather disconcerting news your way. This might arouse some anger within you, and you might be tempted to take it out on the caller. Don't do this! The person is probably only the messenger.

29,"Share more of your passion, love, and happiness with the people around you, Gemini. Put your energy toward a group project and work to co-create something much more magical and meaningful than anything you could create on your own. You aren't alone in this world, and you will find that you have a great deal to learn from working in close relationship with other people who share similar ideals.",1,gemini,2018
30,"Love and romance are first and foremost on your agenda for today, Gemini. You and your romantic partner may leave a gathering of friends to be alone together and talk. You communicate well, and the intense feelings between you could be obvious to both of you, and embarrassingly, to everyone who knows you. If you've been together for a while, talk of commitment or a wedding could come up. Enjoy your day.",1,gemini,2018
31,"Information that you receive from others and from within your own heart could compel you to participate in some ambitious projects, Gemini. They may be work related, connected with a group, or your own. Whatever they are, you're likely to find them interesting, challenging, and personally gratifying. New opportunities for advancement and self-expression could be opening up for you. It's best to move ahead now; otherwise, they might pass you by.",1,gemini,2018
1,"Duels of love and romance are apt to come to a critical climax, Gemini, and you’ll find that the person who is challenging you has quite a bit of gunpowder at his or her disposal. Your best assets are your abilities to communicate and to see both sides of an issue. The key is to not get too emotionally involved, although that’s much easier said than done.",2,gemini,2018
2,"An opposing person or situation may rear its head today, Gemini. Realize that you can draw on the same energy that’s causing them to act and state your point of view for the record. Stand up against this force and let your viewpoint be heard. Sometimes it’s necessary to be a bit rough and outspoken in order to bring peace and balance to an unstable situation.",2,gemini,2018
3,"Your current love interest could be experiencing some family problems, Gemini. Therefore, don't expect too much scintillating conversation this evening. Your partner may seem preoccupied and not be in the best of moods. Rest assured that this has nothing to do with you. Don't let your insecurities get the best of you. Don't demand an explanation. Be there, even if it means being silent, and let your partner think things out. This is tactful and will certainly be appreciated.",2,gemini,2018
4,"An enhanced feeling of determination could motivate you today, Gemini. Finish the things that aren't complete and make some plans for this evening. Don't hesitate to take on something that feels complicated or big. Chances are you'll be able to handle most anything and it will feel great when it's finished. Enjoy your day by making the most of opportunity.",2,gemini,2018
5,"If there's something crafty or artsy you've had your eye on and would really like to get but can't afford, Gemini, consider making it. Even if you don't consider yourself artistic, you may surprise yourself if you give a project half a chance. There are numerous websites that cater to novices and can give you the support and instruction you need. Don't dismiss your ability. Explore this avenue and see about finding a creative niche for yourself.",2,gemini,2018
6,"Today may bring a keen sense of empathy and understanding, Gemini. With this, verbal communication is also more likely to be effective. Consider seizing this energy by making a point of talking through any problems or issues you have with those in your life. If they don't live with you, see about driving over to visit them or calling them up to work things out. If there isn't anything pressing, see about expressing your affection for those closest to you by telling them straight out what they mean to you.",2,gemini,2018
7,"Don't fall into the ""poor me"" trap today, Gemini. When things repeatedly don't go the way you want, or bad things happen to you, it can be very easy to fall into a victim mentality. Yet while we can’t always control what happens around and to us, we always have the choice as to how we're going to handle it. Grieving can be a critical element to healing, but there's a fine line. Choose to keep going and insist on being better to yourself.",2,gemini,2018
8,"Today is a good day to think about your ambitions, Gemini. Considering what you really want out of life can be instrumental in setting goals and making dreams come true. Reaching them can often be as simple as making a decision and taking that first step. For example, if your dream is to have your ideal partner, and you're with someone who isn't, the practical choice is to end the current relationship. Fear, worry, and lack of confidence are the things that can keep you from moving.",2,gemini,2018
9,"Your ability to concentrate will be enhanced today, Gemini. If you have studying or detailed work to tend to, this will be an opportune time to get to it. Hobbies that require a lot of focus may also strike your fancy. Even if a herd of stampeding elephants runs through your space, you aren’t likely to lose your concentration. Pull out your most intensive tasks and have a great day.",2,gemini,2018
10,"Today you can expect some noticeable changes in your neighborhood, Gemini. Some new neighbors who might become your friends could be moving in. This could alter your life ever so subtly, turning it in a more positive direction. You could click immediately with these new people, realizing that they share a lot of your interests. Don't overanalyze this situation, but don't write it off as coincidence either. Just make the most of it!",2,gemini,2018
11,"News could come your way, perhaps through local magazines or newspapers, about possible renovations occurring in your community. These changes could be rather controversial, Gemini, so don't be surprised if you hear a lot of gossip and a number of opinions, both pro and con, on the matter. You might want to delve more deeply into the facts before forming an opinion of your own. This could prove quite enlightening!",2,gemini,2018
12,"Books, lectures, and other sources of information regarding spiritual, metaphysical, or religious matters could have your mind spinning, Gemini. What you read or hear is likely to be fascinating, but you might be too overwhelmed to make sense of it right now. Don't feel that you have to get it all together today. Do something else, let it all stew, and tomorrow its meaning could all appear to you in a rush.",2,gemini,2018
13,"Missed connections and unfortunate misunderstandings will happen less frequently if you slow down and focus. Remember that you can do things yourself, Gemini. Don't feel like you absolutely need approval from others before tackling the projects that you wish to complete. Your mind is urging you to take the initiative today, so feel free to do so. Just make sure you aren't too hasty in your actions. You’ll be more productive if you think before you act.",2,gemini,2018
14,"Group activities might prove a little unsettling for you today, Gemini. Animated discussions could turn into angry quarrels and this could offend your desire for harmony. A lot of misinformation could be exchanged today and cause confusion and short tempers. Stay home if you can, but if you must go out, don't be afraid to leave at the first sign of arguments. They aren't likely to accomplish much after that anyway.",2,gemini,2018
15,"A chance to travel, perhaps for business purposes, could present itself to you today, Gemini. This might require some temporary adjustments in your personal life, but don't let this stop you. You'll want to make the most of whatever new opportunities come your way at this time. Career success is highly indicated, and this could make a profound and positive difference in the course of your life. Go for the gold!",2,gemini,2018
16,"Studying some paperwork involving your finances could bring a pleasant surprise. You’re better off than you thought, Gemini! Dividends or benefits of some kind might be forthcoming. You could decide to treat yourself, buy some gifts for your family, or perhaps do some work on your home. Do take care to avoid impulse buying, and don't go crazy spending. You don't want your funds to disappear as quickly as they came!",2,gemini,2018
17,"Some rather unsettling communications could come your way today, perhaps from out of state. This isn't likely to be anything serious, Gemini, but it could be enough to put your nose a little out of joint. Changes in your neighborhood might interfere with your daily routine. A neighbor or relative could be ill and you might feel obligated to help them out a little. This is fine as long as you don't commit to too much.",2,gemini,2018
18,"Books and movies may inspire you to get involved in artistic activities. Your aesthetic sense is very high today, Gemini, and you may be drawing your inspiration from the higher realms.

A warm and loving letter or phone call could come from a romantic partner, elevating your mood even more. It’s a very emotionally gratifying day.",2,gemini,2018
19,"Is your boss a woman, Gemini? If so, stay out of her way today. To put it mildly, she isn’t in a good mood. Work hard, be very sweet to everyone, and make copious use of your innate diplomacy. You may be on the receiving end of some sharp words, but by remaining focused and continuing your routine in your usual efficient manner, you should avoid any major blowups. Try to stay calm, and hope she goes home early!",2,gemini,2018
20,"Too much exposure to books, newspapers, and computers today could produce eyestrain headaches, Gemini, so try to exercise a little caution when working with small print or computer text. Thoughts of love and romance could interfere with your ability to do your work effectively. You may be tempted to spend most of your time on the phone. We all have days like this, so don't fight it. Just make sure you're feeling great when the evening rolls around!",2,gemini,2018
21,"Dark, depressing dreams could plague your sleep tonight, Gemini, probably alternating with silly ones that make you laugh out loud. You could wake in the morning totally confused by these images, and your tendency might be to dismiss them. Don't do this. Your dreams are trying to tell you something about yourself. Have you had your emotional ups and downs lately? Have you alternately laughed and cried over something? Think about it!",2,gemini,2018
22,"Your efforts on the domestic front have certainly paid off, Gemini. Your home is looking wonderful. Everyone who enters says so. Some unexpected visitors may stop by for a quick hello and wind up staying for dinner. You are a natural, gracious host, not to mention a great cook. Who can blame your guests for wanting to stay?",2,gemini,2018
23,"It's hard to deny the power of a chemical reaction to another person. You’ll likely meet someone today or perhaps you've just met someone who has a strong influence on you, Gemini. You can’t get this person out of your mind. It isn’t clear whether this is a one-time fling or a long-term romance. Whatever it turns out to be, you’re thrilled to be feeling so excited and alive.",2,gemini,2018
24,"Disappointment in a prominent public figure you've always admired could cause an ethical crisis today, Gemini. You might find yourself doubting beliefs and values that you've accepted without question for most of your life. Bear in mind that this is actually a healthy process. By tomorrow you'll probably have made peace with yourself, and should have done some growing up in the meantime. Hang in there!",2,gemini,2018
25,"Prosperity is just around the corner, Gemini, if it isn’t here already. All your efforts are about to pay off and in a big way. It may be that a big proposal gets accepted at work, or perhaps a manuscript that you've penned lands you a publisher. Your innate talent and good fortune combine to bring wonderful things your way. Enjoy this welcome change of events!",2,gemini,2018
26,"An intense passion has been released within you, Gemini. You find it hard to resist the urge to take your loved one and run away to some deserted island. You could use a break from civilization. But if you can't quite make it to that island, how about creating an oasis right in your own home? Order some food from your favorite restaurant, bring it home, and enjoy an intimate evening with your partner.",2,gemini,2018
27,"Beware lawyers, bankers, and stockbrokers today, Gemini. One of them is likely to try and mislead you with some inaccurate information. While it might be in his or her best interests for you to take this information at face value, it certainly isn't in yours! Do your own research and get all the facts before making the financial investments recommended to you.",2,gemini,2018
28,"An unexpected conversation with a current or potential romantic partner could end with both of you revealing a lot of your deepest feelings, Gemini. This discussion may only indirectly concern the status of your relationship, but you will learn a lot about each other that could cause you to seriously consider whether or not you want to continue the relationship. However, all signs indicate that the relationship might change slightly but will continue.",2,gemini,2018
1,"You want nothing more than to be alone today. For that to happen, Gemini, you need to turn off your phone, shut off the computer, and hang a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door. Even then, your friends are likely to walk past the sign and ask what's for dinner. It's one of those days. People want to congregate and they want to do it at your house. Order your favorite comfort food and enjoy the chaos!",3,gemini,2018
2,"Today could be a strange day where money is concerned, Gemini. You might not be sure exactly where you stand financially, so it might be a good idea to get all your records together and go over them carefully.

Instead, get whatever information you can on investments that interest you, study them, and make appropriate decisions later.",3,gemini,2018
3,"You're asked to spring into action today, Gemini, so don't resist it. Be aware of the fact that things may not be as they seem. There could be a strange façade over the situation that you should be aware of before you act. Your head may seem a bit clouded. Your fantasy world is especially active today, so you might feel the urge to run away and never come back. That might not be a bad idea.",3,gemini,2018
4,"You might have planned an exciting evening with friends or your current love interest, but you have to postpone it due to forces beyond your control. This could prove both disappointing and frustrating, Gemini, but there won't be much you can do about it. Just reschedule and plan something else for tonight. Distracting yourself might be the best way to go. See a movie or play on your own.",3,gemini,2018
5,"You should be feeling especially creative at this time. Social events could put you in touch with some exciting new people, Gemini. Contact with those in interesting professions could open up new personal and intellectual avenues to explore today. New friends could come your way, and your romantic situation should intensify. Expect some exciting discussions and the opportunity to learn more about the professions and personalities of the people around you.",3,gemini,2018
6,"Decisions don't have to be as hard as you make them, Gemini. You may feel as if a strong force is pulling you in a clear direction, so don't resist it. You'll only drive yourself crazy trying to list all the reasons why you should or shouldn't go the way you're destined to go. Make things easier on yourself by going with the flow instead of letting your mind interfere with constant chatter and resistance.",3,gemini,2018
7,"Take advantage of the creative energy in the air today, Gemini. Keep your hands moving and your imagination flowing toward something fun and artistic.

Give yourself free rein to open up and explore whatever comes to mind.",3,gemini,2018
8,"A radical force seems to be stirring up trouble and challenging your long-established beliefs about how things should be done and what you hold most dear, Gemini. The truth is that what you might see as trouble is really a growing pain to be endured as you move to the next step in your personal evolution. Change is often difficult; however, this is what you're being called upon to do.",3,gemini,2018
9,"Communication with a significant other might hit a brick wall, and you may not be able to get through. Money could be coming in the mail, Gemini, but probably won't arrive today.

Encourage others to not take life so seriously. Be creative in your approach to helping people lighten up.",3,gemini,2018
11,"A great sense of duty toward your fellow humans is likely to drive your actions, Gemini. Think of yourself as an important role model for young people.

Work through these feelings and identify the root of the problem.",3,gemini,2018
13,"Be prepared for all-out combat with people today, Gemini, even though this is pretty much the opposite of your normal style. In fact, ""opposite"" is the name of the game for you today.

You're surrounded by love and are likely to remain so.",3,gemini,2018
16,"Relationships with others are important to you, Gemini. As a result, you've learned to be polite and congenial. Social engagements today could give you a chance to use your people skills.

These activities could keep you away from home and family longer than you'd like, but you'll end the day with a strong sense of accomplishment.",3,gemini,2018
17,"If you look carefully today, Gemini, you're apt to notice aspects of people that you never noticed before. There could be a frenzy of activity that catches you in its net and takes you away. Look to other people for guidance as you go along. When you ask for help, you'll get it. At the same time, you'll learn a great deal about the people who end up helping you.",3,gemini,2018
18,"A couple with a child might visit you today. One or both of these people could be connected with you in a business capacity. Whatever the connection, Gemini, a lot of interesting discussion should take place, and promising plans for the future could well be made. Take care not to stay up too late, however. Your mind could go a thousand miles an hour and you'll need to unwind so you can sleep!",3,gemini,2018
19,"Trust that you have all the facts you need today, Gemini. You should be feeling quite good, emotionally. Use this self-confidence to make great strides in whatever you want to accomplish. Have fun letting your mind drift to a fanciful world where it can explore your imaginative proclivities. Feel free to use your strong hold on facts as a base to take off into a highly creative and intuitive realm.",3,gemini,2018
20,"Dreams with mixed messages might trouble your sleep tonight. One minute you'll be having a wonderful dream, and the next could be black and gloomy. Write them down, Gemini. The message is probably more positive than it appears. Worries about money might plague you throughout the day, yet things probably aren't as bad as they seem. Make sure you learn the facts about your situation before allowing yourself to panic!",3,gemini,2018
21,"You may appear to have your head in the clouds today, Gemini. The truth is, you've got a lot of important things on your mind. Others might be offended or even amused at your distance. Try not to worry about this too much. You need to take care of resolving those problems you've been ruminating on before worrying about everyone else's reaction.",3,gemini,2018
22,"Extra money may come your way today as a reward for work well done. Perhaps you're getting a substantial bonus, or maybe you're slated for a significant raise. Either way, Gemini, you're going to be in pretty good financial shape. You're going to be feeling very optimistic about your future, and therefore your relations with others will be warm and congenial. Spend the evening celebrating!",3,gemini,2018
23,"Long-term investments, especially those involving real estate, could pay off now, Gemini. If you've been thinking of buying or selling a home, this is the time to do it. All signs indicate that your patience is likely to bear fruit, so at least one of your longtime goals should bring success right now. Also, if you've been considering investing some money in your house, such as remodeling or building an addition, start planning today.",3,gemini,2018
24,"Someone or something has disappeared, Gemini. Gossip could spread like wildfire as everyone imagines the worst. Listening to rumors probably doesn't appeal to your sense of fairness; nonetheless, you're wondering, too. Your comrades will probably experience a mixture of relief and disappointment when this person/thing turns up. Mystery (mostly) solved!",3,gemini,2018
25,"A letter or phone call regarding money that you may be expecting may still not come today, Gemini. This could put you in a panic and cause you to want to phone those responsible to see what's going on. Don't be surprised if you end up playing phone tag. This just isn't a good day for any sort of communication. Your call will come. Just hang in there for a day or two more.",3,gemini,2018
26,"Intuition enhances communications of all kinds today, Gemini. If you've been thinking about doing some writing, this is the day to get started. Your mind is particularly expansive, and your imagination is working at a very high level. Insights that might not normally come to you add new depth and dimension to your writing, whether a poem, novel, article, or letter to a friend. Make the most of it!",3,gemini,2018
27,"The planetary energy makes this a good day for contemplation rather than action, Gemini. If you feel the urge to buy, don't. Sleep on decisions. If you feel the same tomorrow, go for it. If you're in the middle of a conflict at work, try not to take sides. Tell anyone who asks your opinion that you need time to think about it. Consider scheduling an hour of meditation. The word for today is Zen!",3,gemini,2018
28,"If you're single, Gemini, a new love could appear right there in your neighborhood. The person should be attractive, intelligent, free spirited, and very much attracted to you! You could meet this person in an unusual way and end up spending time together and making plans to spend more. Take care not to move too quickly. You won't want this new relationship to be like a meteor, burning out as quickly as it appeared.",3,gemini,2018
29,"If you own your own home, Gemini, you may learn today that its value has increased substantially. If you don't own a home but want to buy one, this is the time to start looking. Any investments made now, particularly in land, will probably be solid and apt to gain in value, although results might take some time to materialize. Carefully consider all contingencies before committing, however. This isn't the time to act impulsively.",3,gemini,2018
30,"Expanding your horizons is definitely on the agenda today, Gemini. Travel, education, creativity – they're all coming to the forefront of your concerns. Romance should also be going well. A friend could introduce you to a new interest, and children might also be a source of joy. Happiness reigns as you're able to spend more time pursuing the concerns that mean the most to you. Any mundane irritations notwithstanding, this should be a beautiful day.",3,gemini,2018
31,"Expect a hectic pace today, Gemini. Some of your colleagues may have been procrastinating a little and now everything has to be done at once. Don't get too frustrated, however. There are unspoken reasons for their behavior that they haven't shared with you. Just do the best you can and hope that others will as well. If some of it has to wait, it won't be the end of the world!",3,gemini,2018
1,"Are your views about certain intellectual or spiritual matters slowly changing, Gemini? If so, you may not be all that comfortable with the changes. Traditional values and ideas could seem especially attractive to you today, so your resistance could be greater than normal. Yet you know you can't stay the same way forever. Give yourself a break today. Tomorrow you'll be back in the groove and on your way to transforming.",4,gemini,2018
2,"Freedom is a key aspect of life today, Gemini. You might find that your brain wants to break free and pursue more independent ways of thinking. Don't worry if such ways of thinking lead you into unknown territory. This is a sign that this is probably where you need to be. Your witty banter could take a sudden twist that surprises both you and the people you're talking to.",4,gemini,2018
3,"You're likely to have tremendous concentration that seems to have materialized out of nowhere. Use this to your advantage, Gemini, because it may not last long. You're usually blown from one thing to another like a leaf in the wind, and it's hard for you to settle on one project or issue for an extended time. You may have to shut a few people out in order to finish some tasks, but that's fine. Do what you have to do.",4,gemini,2018
4,"You could be teetering between the real world and a fantasy realm, Gemini. The fantasy world is more than likely the one that wins out, but that doesn't mean you should lose all touch with reality. If anyone can bridge these two worlds, it's you. You'll probably find yourself drawn to art, which can wonderfully bridge the two. Indeed, your creative juices are gushing like a waterfall today.",4,gemini,2018
5,"Feeling grumpy lately, Gemini? Don't fret, because your bad mood won't last. This attitude is unlike you. Co-workers notice your change in personality but still treat you with consideration and respect. You're fortunate to be able to draw upon a considerable wealth of kindness and good karma that you have built up over the years. Your friends and loved ones treat your mood as an aberration, which is exactly what it is.",4,gemini,2018
6,"If you have grievances about your love life, Gemini, today is the day to speak up. Indeed, today requires only total honesty and forthrightness in all areas. You can expect to confront ""the other,"" whether it's your mate or co-worker, on the basis of truth and righteousness. Rest assured you'll command his or her attention! Be careful that the weight of your words doesn't surpass that of your thoughts.",4,gemini,2018
7,"A number of great ideas either for new creative projects or enhancing ongoing ones could pop into your head during the day, Gemini. If you don't write them down immediately, they could just as easily pop right out again, never to return! With all your responsibilities, you could have a rather frantic day as your mind constantly shifts from one focus to another. Stay with it. You can handle it.",4,gemini,2018
8,"Today your mind should be especially quick and penetrating, Gemini. You could decide to tackle some in-depth research that you've been considering doing for a while on a subject that fascinates you. You might also want to discuss the subject with someone close to you who shares this interest. Don't be surprised if you come up with some intriguing insights. Write everything down. You may want to make use of it later.",4,gemini,2018
9,"Your artistic abilities could seem a bit blocked today, Gemini. You could be anxious to complete a half-finished project, but at this point you may have no idea where to go with it. Don't panic! Do something else for a day or two and ideas will probably flow as if by magic. If you don't have a tight deadline, there's no rush to complete the work now. Give it some time!",4,gemini,2018
10,"Your energy is probably pretty low today, Gemini. You won't feel like socializing, nor will you feel like staying in and reading or watching TV. Chances are you won't know what to do with yourself all day. Under these circumstances, the best thing to do is find a distraction. Go work out, read a thrilling book, go to a funny movie. Get your mind off your lethargy and it could well disappear.",4,gemini,2018
11,"Are you considering moving to a new residence, redecorating, or making some home improvements, Gemini? If so, this is a good time to do it.

Explore every possibility, consider all the pros and cons, and then if it looks like it's going to work, go for it!",4,gemini,2018
12,"In future years, you might remember today as one of the best days of your life, Gemini. Romance should be going beautifully. You could exchange deeply felt words of love with your partner. The future looks bright, and you should be full of enthusiastic plans for pursuing what you really want to do. You should also be feeling especially strong, energetic, healthy, and ready to try anything. A journey could be coming up soon.",4,gemini,2018
13,"You could be overwhelmed with information today, Gemini, as you receive more phone calls and email messages than you can possibly answer. Be clear about your priorities and stick with them. Otherwise, you're likely to spend the day being batted around the court like a tennis ball. Take a lot of deep breaths throughout the day and make an effort to keep your temper in check.",4,gemini,2018
14,"Today you could discover a talent for investment, real estate, or other form of money management that you never thought you had, Gemini. The opportunity to make an investment or cash in on one could enable you to take strides toward making your money grow. This might be a good time to buy or sell any type of property. You might also want to do some reading on future investment opportunities.",4,gemini,2018
15,"You might want to straighten up the house this morning, Gemini. Some unexpected visitors could drop by. With no warning, you could be serving lunch or dinner to a group of ten! Don't panic. Take-out was created for just such an occasion. Pull out the linens from the back of the closet, make a few calls to your favorite bakery or restaurant, and voilà! The meal is served.",4,gemini,2018
16,"You could be startled to find that your artistic talents, although dormant for a while, are called into service today. A particular undertaking of those around you could benefit from your gift in this area. Don't panic, Gemini, you won't be expected to do this alone. Others will pitch in and help. One thing to be careful of today is not let your emotions run away with you. It could spoil everything.",4,gemini,2018
17,"Today is filled with socializing, with a strong emphasis on the exchange of information. If you're attending a party this evening, Gemini, be receptive to anyone you meet. It's likely that someone new will arrive who will have a significant impact on your life. It might be that he or she tips you off about a professional opportunity at work. It's even possible that this person will turn into a romantic interest. You never know!",4,gemini,2018
18,"You're a conscientious, hard worker, Gemini, but today your thoughts are more on home than work. You feel especially close to your family and friends. They mean the most to you. Jobs and even careers come and go, but friends and family are forever. Enjoy being with them today. Gather everyone together and order too much Chinese take-out. It's just fine if you restart your diet tomorrow.",4,gemini,2018
19,"Today, Gemini, forget socializing, working, and answering the phone. Stay home and cuddle in a blanket by the fire. Get out your old yearbooks or photo albums and have fun reflecting on good times from your past. Enjoy being quiet and still. Listen to the ticking of the clock and the wind outside. Measure time by the shadows moving across the room. Give yourself this day of meditation.",4,gemini,2018
20,"Your positive strength is especially noticeable today. You may find that you're radiating gloriously to the people around you, Gemini. This is due to your polite, gentle, and peaceful nature. You're the jewel that isn't always noticed or appreciated as much as it should be. More than likely, you leave it up to others to make the first move. Consider being the instigator today. The world is in your hands.",4,gemini,2018
21,"This probably isn't a good day to do work that concerns money, Gemini. Your mind may not be in the right space. You could make errors that cause problems. If possible, also avoid working on any kind of creative project, since your mind might not be very clear and you probably won't be happy with the results. However, this is a great day for routine work that doesn't require much concentration.",4,gemini,2018
22,"Research that you've been doing for a particular project may finally be completed, Gemini. Now you're ready to finish your work. Your mind is especially sharp right now, so this is a good time to work on any kind of project that involves communication. If you're a writer, your publishing prospects look good. Romance also should be going well. Perhaps you just became aware of a strong psychic bond between you and your beloved. Make the most of it!",4,gemini,2018
23,"Are you waiting for a love partner to phone you at work, Gemini? As much as you want to hear from your friend, you could well get so caught up in your work that you wouldn't hear a marching band go by. As you work, be sure to keep one ear tuned to the real world by looking up or getting up and walking around occasionally. Otherwise, you might sabotage what you want the most today.",4,gemini,2018
24,"You need rest, Gemini. Even though you have a long list of tasks, see if you can leave some for later. All signs indicate that you shouldn't stray too far from home today if you can help it. You're easily distracted, which makes you prone to accidents. Being behind the wheel of a car isn't the place for you right now. Stay home and tackle all those little chores you've been meaning to finish.",4,gemini,2018
25,"You would make an excellent judge, Gemini. You're able to consider all aspects of a situation. This is a bit of a blessing and a curse, because it can make it difficult to come to a decision. Today you could face the challenge of reconsidering past decisions. Once-binding contracts need to be reviewed and new ones created. Prior commitments need reevaluation. This is tiring but necessary if you're to move forward.",4,gemini,2018
26,"This is a perfect day for falling in love, Gemini! You can expect anything to happen today. You could even meet someone who is ready to love, support, and listen to you when you need him or her most. You need to put all your fears and hesitations behind you on a day like today. Besides, a little madness every now and then won't hurt. Throw caution to the wind!",4,gemini,2018
27,"Just as a watched pot never boils, so, too, do anxiously awaited checks or letters refuse to arrive in the mail, Gemini. Beyond double-checking that the person or company has your correct address, there isn't much you can do but continue to wait. Trust that it will arrive shortly, and then your financial difficulties will be behind you.",4,gemini,2018
28,"Gemini, today you could feel the need to work on your finances - pay bills, make deposits, and plan a budget for next month - but your heart won't be in it. Your mind is probably on more interesting projects. If you try to force it, you'll be unable to concentrate, so it could be a waste of time. It won't hurt if you wait a few days. You should be in a more practical space by then.",4,gemini,2018
29,"A sudden desire to expand your horizons could have you and possibly a romantic partner considering returning to school, Gemini, perhaps for an advanced degree. The school you're considering, however, might be located in another state or even a foreign country. Following through with your desire could require some careful planning. As a result, you and your beloved may have some intense conversations over the next few days.",4,gemini,2018
30,"Some gossip about a friend could reach your ears today, Gemini, and it might seem a bit shocking at first. Money could be involved. However, don't accept what you hear at face value. Whoever got the rumor going is apt to be less concerned with the truth than serving a personal agenda. Call your friend and try to learn the facts without prying. They're probably far less dire than the gossip implies.",4,gemini,2018
1,"There is some probability that you'll want to escape from reality today, Gemini. You aren't anxious to face a situation that demands that you commit yourself. Is this because you're afraid that you lack the ability to assume this new responsibility? This is an honest-to-goodness chance to fulfill your dreams of success. There can be no question of evading it! Get busy!",5,gemini,2018
2,"How focused you are, Gemini! You're so calm and collected. Of course, the mood is especially hospitable to sobriety, reasonableness, and hard work. The horizon is clear, and you have all the information you require to navigate the seas of life. All you need is a little more faith and courage. If you don't succeed today, you'll have no one to blame but yourself.",5,gemini,2018
3,"Take your creativity to a new level, Gemini. There are many ways to express yourself creatively, so pick one and follow through. You may have a desire to be on stage, and you want to share your dreams and inner passion with the world. Your strong emotions and dreamy perspective are assets. Don't try to stuff them inside or push them away. Listening to your brain too much could deprive you of the bounty in your heart and imagination.",5,gemini,2018
4,Days like today push you to act in the areas of your life where you may have hesitated before. Does your love life need a breath of fresh air? Have you been dreaming of a nice candlelit dinner with your partner? A weekend in the country? A new home? It's time to stop dreaming of happiness and do what you need to do to get it. It's well within your reach.,5,gemini,2018
5,"Some strange and rather gloomy dreams could come your way tonight, Gemini. They could, if you let them, catapult you into a rather depressed mood during the day. Writing them down might help exorcise the negative emotions. You could also be a bit depressed over money. This isn't a good day to make investments, start a new business, or open up a savings account. Wait a few days until the planets relax a little.",5,gemini,2018
6,"While you may not have been feeling quite your usual self over the past day or two, Gemini, today you're likely to be feeling mentally and physically stronger and more focused.

This is the day to look into ways to ensure it. Enjoy your day.",5,gemini,2018
7,"Communication with others should be very effective, Gemini, and your social calendar will be full. You're feeling good about yourself, thanks to a boost in confidence that reminds you that you can do anything. You have the ability to juggle many things at once and the physical endurance to keep up a quick pace. Even though you may tend to be rather lazy, you might get a sudden inspiration to join a gym or sports team.",5,gemini,2018
8,"When it comes to romance in your life, Gemini, there may be a great deal of talk but not enough action. Perhaps you're a terrific flirt who can keep things moving at a quick pace intellectually, but nothing really comes of it when you have to take concrete action and manifest those words in a romantic setting. This is one day when this conflict of interests makes itself known more blatantly than usual.",5,gemini,2018
9,"Today your intellectual and expressive abilities should receive a boost from the planets. It's an excellent time to organize your thoughts about presenting a project to a possible collaborator, engage in trade, or write. In terms of your private life, it's also a good time to examine the latest events, certain aspects of which are still partially misunderstood.",5,gemini,2018
10,"Some people tend to make mountains out of molehills. Currently, you're likely to feel as though you're surrounded by people who exaggerate problems. You, on the other hand, have a loftier perspective. You're a visionary who can foresee future social trends. This gift would serve you well as a political speechwriter, should you want to take on that sort of job.",5,gemini,2018
11,"The moment has come to affirm your individuality and life choices, Gemini. The planetary energy will make you work hard to rethink the number of obligations you undertake. Admit it – they've been weighing you down. You can exist comfortably without them, and you can accomplish all that you do with much more effectiveness and enthusiasm if you lighten your load. By all means, liberate yourself!",5,gemini,2018
12,"If you give the impression that you're in a reserved and introspective mood (even if you aren't), you'll succeed in avoiding confrontation.

But even in this atmosphere, it is still a great day to evaluate your fundamental objectives a little more closely.",5,gemini,2018
13,"You might be planning to host a social event in your home tonight or perhaps in a few days. It could have you doing a lot of cleaning, rearranging, and beautifying around the house.

Don't work too hard, Gemini, or you might not have any energy left for your family or guests!",5,gemini,2018
14,"Today your brain is supercharged, Gemini. If you've been thinking about doing some writing or have put off analyzing a particularly tricky problem, this would be the perfect day to get started. You'll have all the inspiration you could possibly need. And don't worry about shocking the people around you with your directness and assertiveness. They'll appreciate your valuable ideas.",5,gemini,2018
15,"Today is the day to rethink all those social values that you take at face value, Gemini. Like the rest of us, you learned them at a young age and unthinkingly accepted them. Established concepts of propriety are especially deserving of consideration. After hearing for years about all those things that “just aren't done,"" isn't it refreshing to think that maybe they should be done after all?",5,gemini,2018
16,"If you have grievances to voice about your love life, Gemini, this is the day to speak up. Indeed, anything less than total honesty won't be tolerated today. You can expect to confront the “other,"" whether mate, friend, or family member, on the basis of truth and righteousness. Know that you'll command their attention! But be careful that the weight of your words doesn't surpass that of your thoughts.",5,gemini,2018
17,"You might need to hold your tongue today, Gemini. People's feelings are more easily hurt now, and the slightest criticism could be misinterpreted as a terrible insult. When in doubt, keep your mouth shut. Turn your attention inward and focus on your emotions. Try to keep your mental chatter to a minimum and concentrate more on how you feel rather than on what you think.",5,gemini,2018
18,"You may have felt somewhat frustrated in your initiatives over the past few days, Gemini. Either outside obstacles, such as events that caused delays, or inner restraints, such as your own apathy, presented a clear challenge to you. Certain matters must be resolved before you can make any real progress. The day ahead may give you an opportunity to settle these issues once and for all.",5,gemini,2018
19,"Has it been difficult these past few days to communicate with those close to you? Are you a little skeptical about your charm? In fact, have you been feeling somewhat unsure of yourself in general? The day ahead is excellent for a fresh start. You're full of confidence. You have a natural gift for diplomacy, and your sense of refinement will once again be noticed and appreciated.",5,gemini,2018
20,"Restriction might weigh heavily on you today, Gemini. Perhaps you're being reminded that there are some important details that you need to take care of.

This is an important time in which you can hit it big.",5,gemini,2018
21,"Remember that it's OK to have a little downtime, Gemini. Don't feel like you have to always be up and on stage. Take some time to be mellow and quiet.

23,"You may want to keep your ship on an even keel today, Gemini, but remember that no matter how hard as you try, this simply might not be possible. The wind is blowing pretty hard and you might just have to trim your sails and go full speed ahead. You'll move much more quickly, but it will also mean that you'll be more prone to capsizing. Live on the edge.",5,gemini,2018
24,"Two different sides could be tugging at you, Gemini. It may be that neither one is really making a strong case for pulling you one way or the other. Realize that adjustments may have to be made in order for you to fit in the scheme of things and fulfill your responsibilities. A close loved one may be distracting you in subtle ways. Try not to get too sidetracked if you can help it.",5,gemini,2018
25,"You may have gotten a financial boost lately in the form of some sort of raise or reward, Gemini. The day ahead will make you realize that more discipline and work will be necessary if you want to continue to prosper.

Realize that beauty resides all around you, not just in stores full of expensive objects.",5,gemini,2018
27,"Things that have been out of whack in your life should begin to come back into balance, Gemini. The bad news is that it may take a while for the pendulum to return to the optimal point.

28,"You may feel as if you're sinking into an emotional vortex, Gemini. Be careful about assuming that things are yours when they aren't really.

Keeping things in balance may be difficult with the great amount of emotional sensitivity in the air at this time.",5,gemini,2018
29,"A change has occurred in our solar system, Gemini, a shift that will probably be imperceptible but nonetheless profound. You have seven months to understand how this change impacts you. It will dawn on you that you feel a strong need for liberation. Perhaps you need to release yourself from the bonds of a group. Innovation is in the air!",5,gemini,2018

Consider keeping your feet on the ground with your friend.",5,gemini,2018
1,"Explore deeply your innovative, irrational side today, Gemini. Your emotions may run counter to this principle, but instead of letting this put a damper on your progress, use the energy to spur you to action.

3,"The arts might seem especially appealing today, Gemini. Also, you could fall in love. If you're currently involved, expect circumstances to develop that show the exalted side of your partner that you sometimes forget. If you aren't involved, expect someone wonderful to appear. Remember to get to know the person before getting hooked. However perfect the person appears now, he or she is still human.",6,gemini,2018
4,"Today you might be feeling particularly warm and loving toward a romantic partner, and the feeling is likely reciprocated. You could have trouble reaching each other to make arrangements to meet, Gemini. Phone messages may not be received, or perhaps the person has something important to do. Eventually the two of you will speak, even if you aren't able to do what you want before tomorrow.",6,gemini,2018
5,"Emotional matters could hit the fan today at a social event or group meeting of some kind. Those around you are apt to be feeling especially stressed and volatile, Gemini, so be prepared for anything. Try to stay out of passionate confrontations, and don't try to put oil on troubled waters. At times like this, such attempts only cause unwanted attention to focus on you.

Take care of your pets, too.",6,gemini,2018

Take time to write down your thoughts since you'll want to remember them. Enjoy!",7,gemini,2018
12,"You may get pushed around by two very powerful camps today, Gemini. Since you're the kind, diplomatic, and sensitive one, you make the perfect target for more abrasive and opinionated people.

As a naturally polite and socially astute person, you might feel obligated to accept any and all invitations. This isn't a good day to commit yourself.

20,"Reclaim control of things that might be holding you back now, Gemini. You may find that there's an element of restriction to the day that's keeping you from getting where you want to be.

Go with your instincts rather than rely so much on your thoughts.",7,gemini,2018

Or it could be that you need to change your approach.",7,gemini,2018
31,"Today it's important that you make your own decisions and stick with them, Gemini. Much as you prefer to depend on others, your judgment really is best.

Just do it.",7,gemini,2018
1,"You're an individual, Gemini, but sometimes it's hard for you to suppress your uniqueness in order to get the job done. It may not be you. The problem may be your job.

9,"Either your lover or a colleague is likely to be irritable today, Gemini, which you might find upsetting. Bear in mind that this person's mood probably has little, if anything, to do with you or anything you've said or done. Just stay out of the way until your friend gets over it. This isn't a good day to host or attend social events or even accept invitations. Wait until tomorrow.",8,gemini,2018
10,"Miscommunication with someone from far away could lead to bruised egos, heightened emotions, and angry phone calls. It's best not to get drawn into a quarrel, Gemini.

Walk - it will clear your head and get you where you're going more quickly.",8,gemini,2018
11,"Today you might complete a difficult project that's important to your career.

20,"Don't fear change, Gemini. Even if you think you don't adjust well, you have far more adaptability than you realize. Without change, life would become stagnant and lifeless.

In doing so, you could form some powerful new friendships.",11,cancer,2017
23,"Uncertainty about your financial future might have you developing some sort of savings or investment plan to give you more security. You'll probably find the help you need, as today's planets show that you should succeed at anything you try. A slight malaise could cause you to turn to vitamins, herbs, yoga, or some other sort of healing method that can put you back on your feet.",11,cancer,2017
24,"The present planetary aspects could change your approach to life. Almost compulsively, you'll need to deepen your relationships with the people you've recently met. You'll probably be attracted to one of them, but be careful, as this person might not feel the same way about you. Look on the bright side. Why would you want to waste your energy on someone who doesn't care about you?",11,cancer,2017
25,"Today is great for creativity, especially the kind that shows your special style. You're productive, although what you've been creating is just a reflection of the latest fashions. This is one of your drawbacks, as it keeps you from being true to your special style. Today you should use your feelings as your inspiration.",11,cancer,2017
26,"Today you may receive some interesting news. It could come in the form of a call or email and will be from someone close to you. Whatever the news, it may spur you to action, necessitating lots of errands and pulling a project together quickly. You're happy, energetic, and certainly up to the task!",11,cancer,2017
27,"A female friend may seem to be upset with you and might not admit it. If you ask what's wrong, she'll probably say, ""Nothing."" Use your intuition to deduce what's bothering her and then try to make it up to her in some way. You might want to reevaluate your friendship. She may be too uncommunicative. The term ""acquaintance"" might suit her better than ""friend.""",11,cancer,2017
28,"This is a day to be directed inward rather than outward. It's a good thing, too, because the outer world isn't too pleasant. Nothing seems to be going right. Checks aren't arriving and calls aren't returned. You're feeling ineffective at best. Take heart. It has nothing to do with you and everything to do with the planets. The mood will pass. Meanwhile, do something fun by yourself.",11,cancer,2017
29,"Creative ideas may elude you today. You may have a hankering to do something artistic but with only a few vague notions, and you may not like those. This is a good day to work with others' ideas. Read, play music by a great composer, copy a painting by a master. This way you'll keep the impulses going without trying to force new ideas that won't come.",11,cancer,2017
30,"Today is good for relationships. Regardless of whether it's personal or professional, you can expect good things to happen. You may be called upon to participate in an unusual group project and strike up some potentially beautiful friendships. At home your mate may be especially thoughtful and demonstrative. You radiate an aura of love and warmth, and people respond in kind.",11,cancer,2017
1,"It looks like you're making headway again. Now that you're planning for the future, you could enroll in an educational program or take a trip. Don't be so dazzled by today's bright outlook that you forget the business at hand. Accept this day for what it is - a brief respite amid the chaos. Tomorrow you'll return to your work refreshed.",12,cancer,2017
2,"There may be a frenzy of activity around you, but you'll be able to handle it. Your charm will get you through any door. You should be able to juggle many things at once, and others will look to you for support. You'll have a level head and calm demeanor and handle things diplomatically and honestly. Don't be surprised if things get more insane as the day wears on, but this shouldn't faze you.",12,cancer,2017
3,"Dive deep. This isn't a day to stay in shallow waters. This is a day to go beyond your normal limits. Although there may be a great emotional charge accompanying everything you do, let this be the excitement that fuels your passion and not the reason to stop. Getting started may be tough, and you may want to spend the day in bed. Once you get going, it may be hard to slow down.",12,cancer,2017
4,"Today you may extend an invitation to someone close to visit you in your home, but don't count on the person being able to make it. Something may come up. Disappointment could make you melancholy, but don't let it get the better of you. Invite someone else or channel that energy into creative or artistic projects. That way you can enjoy the day anyway.",12,cancer,2017
5,"Other people are important to you. Today your relationships could take on even more significance than usual. You could meet some interesting people, and if you're not involved, you might even fall in love. Old and new friends could seem more wonderful and idealized. Romantic relationships could assume fairytale qualities. Try to make an effort to see people as they really are.",12,cancer,2017
6,"A chance to increase your income could come your way. This could involve extra work or investments. Investments involving land or other real estate could be especially profitable now. There could also be contracts or legal papers involved that bring money your way, so be prepared. The end of this year should see you more financially secure than you were at the beginning.",12,cancer,2017
7,"There's plenty to talk about. The hard part is finding a reason to stop talking. Once someone brings up philosophy or religion, it seems like the floodgates open.

Your mind will jump around, and you'll be happy to consider many perspectives, although you'll have the last say about what you believe.",12,cancer,2017
8,"Today will start off with an energy boost for you. Seize the opportunity to make the most of this by getting those major projects and chores handled. It isn't every day that you feel this good.

9,"You may feel like you're spinning your wheels today, especially as the end of the day draws near. Nothing seems to be going your way. Things aren't really as bad as you think.

Don't make the situation any worse than it needs to be.",12,cancer,2017
10,"Help with a creative project - either working on the project or promoting it in some way - could come from an unexpected quarter, increasing your inspiration.

13,"You undoubtedly have the impression that you're seeing more clearly than in the recent past. The planetary energies are lining up to break up the mental fog that you've been experiencing.

14,You might be planning to attend a social event today. You're looking forward to it. Paperwork could take up so much of your time today that you wonder if you can make it. The paperwork doesn't seem to be that urgent. Do as much as you can and then take off and go to your party. You deserve it.,12,cancer,2017
15,"A current or potential love partner may drop out of sight and not return your calls. You could panic, wondering if your friend has lost interest. Don't jump to conclusions. Your partner may be involved in other matters. Remember the old saying, ""If you love something, let it go."" If you cling, it was never yours in the first place.",12,cancer,2017
16,"Heightened imagination and ingenuity could bring new thoughts for advancing yourself in the financial arena.

Whatever you choose to do, today shows promise of being very fortunate.",12,cancer,2017
17,"You may be talking a lot today, but that's natural. You have a great deal to say, so why not say it? You'll have your way with very little effort. Enjoy yourself and feel free to treat yourself in the way you deserve to be treated. Respect yourself and others will respect you. Sit up straight and be proud of who you are.",12,cancer,2017
18,"Promote balance and harmony today by letting off a bit of steam before you try to engage with others and their dramas. Secure yourself in a stable environment where you can vent your concerns, punch pillows, or jog around the block. Once you get that out, you'll have a fresh, new attitude with which to participate in the adventures of the day.",12,cancer,2017
19,This is a great day for you. You're able to get a lot done. You might find a marked seriousness to your emotions that helps you stay on track with everything you need to do. Integrate your plans with others and see what kinds of incredible breakthroughs you can have. You can maintain a pleasant demeanor in every social situation.,12,cancer,2017
20,"The key today is to keep things practical. Try to keep your focus and hold your ground. People aren't going to be concerned with fanciful daydreaming, so keep these feelings to yourself. Do your best to tune into the energy of the group by helping out a greater cause in whatever way you can. Go into a garden and feel the dirt in your hands.",12,cancer,2017
21,Don't get too emotionally attached to your work today. You'll have greater success when you distance yourself from what it is you're trying to achieve. A more neutral perspective on the issue will make you much more effective at getting things done. You have power and you should use it. The key is to make sure that it doesn't rule you.,12,cancer,2017
22,"Are you deeply satisfied with your love life? Several of the aspects will push you to take stock and develop some solutions if needed. A big issue could be your possessiveness. Try an experiment.

23,"You always see both sides of a situation clearly. Today you might judge possible future courses of action in view of the past. Prior values may be put to the test and former opinions revised. You could consider ending a relationship or entering a new one. This may take effort, but it will set the stage for future success.",12,cancer,2017
24,This will be a day rich in reflection. You're able to observe what's going around you while still retaining some distance. Other people's ambitions will amuse you as they play their parts more like caricatures than real people. Stepping back like this benefits you greatly. You should do it more often.,12,cancer,2017
25,"Communication is key today. Make your intentions known right away to avoid unnecessary confusion. The more you can settle now, the better off you'll be down the road.

The bridge you provide fills in a critical gap that will be of great aid to others.",12,cancer,2017
26,"There may be some worries nagging at you. Perhaps you have a financial concern or minor health complaint. Don't let it get you down. You have the inner resources to overcome it. Although the current state of affairs has you feeling gloomy, your optimism will return soon. Until then, put your trust in other values, such as love, friendship, and faith.",12,cancer,2017
27,"The idea of expressing yourself will seem like a joke today. Have you ever stopped to question what expressing yourself really means? This is the ideal time to think about it, especially if you have artistic objectives. Do only what you want to do. Don't force anything. In other words, express yourself for your own sake and not for the sake of others.",12,cancer,2017
28,"People are hesitant to deal with deep emotional issues today. They're erecting protective barriers so the things they hear, see, and feel don't hurt them. Respect these boundaries. Do your best to stay rooted in your inner sanctuary. Try to keep a positive attitude even though the prevailing mood may be somber.",12,cancer,2017
29,"Romance and marriage are always important to you, and today they're especially so. You should feel particularly warm, loving, and attractive, and matters of love and partnership should be especially romantic.

30,"Take a break from your daily routine and get off the track today, Cancer. The world will turn with you for a day, so feel free to tune out for a while. Remember that whatever path you decide to take is the right path. Regret is a useless emotion - don't even bother with it. Enjoy the present day and all the small joys that it has to offer. Communicate your dreams and bring things into balance.",12,cancer,2017
31,"Outside responsibilities might temporarily interfere with your love life, Cancer. You may feel a strong desire to get together with a love partner early in the evening, but circumstances may necessitate your working odd hours.

Most people understand when situations like this crop up.",12,cancer,2017
1,"A chance to make some extra money could come today through someone you know slightly, Cancer, perhaps from a social event you both once attended. You might not be totally familiar with the type of work involved, but today your mind is sharp and so you'll probably pick it up quickly. The only downside is that you could work harder than you need to, and therefore there's a danger of tiring yourself out. Take care of yourself.",1,cancer,2018
2,"You can't force creativity. Not even you, Cancer. As much as you want to produce something fantastic right this minute, you will find that mere mortals such as us need the help of a creative muse. And alas, the muse is a fickle being. You can't just snap your finger and summon it. You must coax it out, slowly, gently. This all takes time, but the end result makes the effort worthwhile. For now, you must sit and wait, and trust that it will come to you.",1,cancer,2018
3,"You're a hard and conscientious worker, Cancer, and sometimes you work so hard that you neglect to take any time for yourself. This is admirable in the short run, but not so wise in the long run. You do no one any good if you burn out from sheer exhaustion. You must learn how to pace yourself and balance your life in such a way that there is ample time for work, play, and meditation.",1,cancer,2018
4,"You have a wonderful, nurturing nature, Cancer. Those around you reap tremendous benefit from your caring soul. Just as you are receptive to the needs of others, so too should you be aware of your own needs. You deserve to be on the receiving end of your own gentle touch. Don't hesitate to turn to others for help if you need to. You might be surprised how mere acquaintances pitch in to lend a hand.",1,cancer,2018
5,"An important career concern could require considerable effort on your part today in order to enable you to advance whatever it is you're trying to accomplish, Cancer. At some point during the day, you may be plagued by doubts as to your ability to do this. However, don't let this cause you to panic. All you need is to muster a little energy and stay focused on the task at hand. Believe that today you're capable of accomplishing wonders.",1,cancer,2018
6,"Professional interests continue to expand, Cancer, and you're managing to keep very busy. Your income is rising, and you could be achieving a certain prominence in your field. Nonetheless, you could be looking for new opportunities. The field you're in now may not be one that you want to continue for the next 20 years. This is therefore a good day to put out a few feelers and test the waters. You might be surprised at the opportunities out there.",1,cancer,2018
7,"All living things benefit from your gifts, Cancer. Nurturing has always been part of your nature, and is especially so today. But sometimes you lavish more attention on others than you do on yourself, and this benefits no one. You will find that you'll have even more of yourself to give when you take the time to fill your own emotional well. Some time off from good works will ultimately be to everyone's benefit, yours especially.",1,cancer,2018
8,"Cancer, right now you could be overwhelmed by conflicts among your own needs, the needs of your family, and your responsibilities toward your job. As a result, you may be feeling tense and stressed out, and wondering if the situation will ever be resolved. Don't panic. It will, and you'll be none the worse for it. The keyword is balance, and the solution lies in finding it. Get to it! You'll want to put this behind you.",1,cancer,2018
9,"It seems your ship is about to come in, Cancer. At least, the planets seem to think so. Your years of cultivating business relationships will pay off in the form of increased sales or new business opportunities. It seems this success spills over into your personal life as well. Life on the home front has never been more serene. You are the conductor of this melodious symphony that is your life. Congratulations!",1,cancer,2018
10,"A love partner may be away, Cancer, causing you to have to put your passions and desires - not to mention the need for your friend's company - on hold. Don't let this catapult you into a lousy mood. If you're artistic, throw all your energies and passions into creative work. If you're athletic, go play a game of tennis or racquetball. Time will pass more quickly that way until your partner returns. Hang in there!",1,cancer,2018
11,"Some unexpected changes could happen today, Cancer. You could find yourself confronting the prospect of having to get used to some new and totally state-of-the-art equipment that you've never used before. Don't panic. You'll do fine, you'll be a real whiz once you get used to it. Try to focus your mind on this for now and learn as much as you can. You can do it!",1,cancer,2018
12,"Good news from a distant state or foreign country could make your day, Cancer. You could well spend the rest of the day basking in the glow of what you've heard. However, this isn't going to affect your relations with others or your work on whatever projects you're involved with right now. This is a good day to get out in the sunshine. Take a walk or drive in the country! Enjoy your day.",1,cancer,2018
13,"An object that you treasure, perhaps a family heirloom, could be missing, Cancer. Don't panic. It's probably somewhere in the house, although it may have slipped behind something or had a pile of other stuff put on top of it. At any rate, it's among other objects. Searching too much, however, could make it more elusive than it should be. Keep looking when you have time and the item will probably turn up in a very strange place!",1,cancer,2018
14,"Today you might find yourself working with an exciting group of people, Cancer. Perhaps this involves an opportunity to increase your skills or a new project or even a whole new job. Your mind is quick and especially innovative, so don't be surprised if you're able to contribute far more than you would have expected. Don't think your efforts will go unappreciated. Friends grow closer to you and acquaintances could become friends.",1,cancer,2018
15,"Some images deriving from dreams or visions might provide inspiration for ideas to redecorate your house, Cancer. You might spend some time perusing books in order to find ways to put your ideas to work for you. Then you'll embrace the task with a passion! Speaking of passion, sex and romance are also very much on your mind at this time. Get a lover to help you with your work. This could propel you to some rather pleasant consequences.",1,cancer,2018
16,"At this time you might be in the space where you tend to doubt concepts and attitudes that you've accepted all your life. You generally tend to be a service-oriented person, Cancer, and today you might want to help out someone close to you. Yet this person may have deeply buried issues that only he or she can deal with, and therefore might give the appearance of being unappreciative. Rest assured that this is not the case.",1,cancer,2018
17,"Your innate practicality and common sense are apt to be called into action on behalf of a group with which you're affiliated, Cancer. Some of them may be feeling muddled, and you're the only one who has what it takes right now to see the matter through. Your own goals could be advanced today because of increased focus and clear thinking. Overall, this should be a great day to work on projects of your own. Enjoy!",1,cancer,2018
18,"You may have preferred not to acknowledge your own psychic abilities in the past, Cancer, but today they could prove impossible to ignore. Visions, premonitions, and telepathic messages from others could pop into your mind all day. This shouldn't be treated as something strange, but rather you should regard it as a source of inner power. Abilities like this increase your understanding of others as well as yourself.",1,cancer,2018
19,"This could be a very studious day for you, Cancer; actually, it might be better to call it laborious. But you love to work, and you will get all the work you can handle today. It's a good day to work on all those things in your life that still need a little attention in order to stand on their own, the things that haven't quite found a permanent place in your life, like some of your relationships, for example.",1,cancer,2018
20,"Your mind is in a period of great activity, and your curiosity about the world around you is practically insatiable. You're interested in anything and everything. You want to be able to understand everything from the simplest to the most complicated. Nothing could get in the way of your thirst for knowledge. So get a good supply of books about the things you would like to learn about and try and meet some new people.",1,cancer,2018
21,"A group with which you're affiliated could ask you to take care of a few tasks. This might involve making phone calls, running errands, or both. Your energy and enthusiasm are high, Cancer, so this is a good day to prove how valuable your work is and how efficient you are. Make sure that you don't take on too much, however. You won't be helping anyone if you tire yourself out.",1,cancer,2018
22,"Someone you've known for a long time but haven't seen for a while could suddenly come back into the picture, Cancer. He or she could attend a social event of some kind or actually drop in to visit your family.

This is a great time to sign up for classes, particularly those involving the arts.",1,cancer,2018
23,"Intellectual or artistic work could take up a lot of your time today, Cancer. Your level of inspiration is high, and you're apt to be full of ideas that others would find beneficial.

This not only increases your career standing, it can help you in the love department. Enjoy your day!",1,cancer,2018
24,"Realize that your inner state of mind is quite apparent to people just by the look on your face, Cancer. Don't think you can hide things from others, especially today. You're better off just saying how you feel even if you think someone may be put off by it. Your emotional state should be strong, so use this to your advantage.",1,cancer,2018
25,"Tasks of any kind are all likely to seem like the labors of Hercules today, Cancer. Overwork and nerve strain could have you feeling a little bit under the weather today, and it might be a good idea for you to take some time alone to rest. If you can't do that, at least try to take things easy. Some unexpected changes in your community might have your neighbors' tongues wagging. Be sure to check out the facts before jumping to any conclusions.",1,cancer,2018
26,"Work of all kinds gets done a lot faster, Cancer, as friends or family members join in assisting you in getting it out of the way. You've made this possible because your intellect has joined with your emotions in strengthening your communication with others. The old saying, ""You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar"" is very true, and you'll learn all about it today! After the tasks are complete, throw an impromptu party!",1,cancer,2018
27,"You may get frustrated when your list of tasks for the day just does not seem to get any shorter, Cancer.

28,"Nightmares that come your way today are likely to cause you to wake up feeling extremely angry for no tangible reason. You might want to take a close look at your dreams and try to analyze them so that you'll learn the source of your ire and how best to expunge it. Disconcerting news about money is likely to prove groundless, Cancer, so don't fly off the handle and get all stressed out when you hear it.",1,cancer,2018
29,"Drastic shifts in your emotions might be causing you to doubt certain instincts or feelings you have, Cancer. Instead of getting frustrated by your inability to make rational sense of these emotions, enjoy the ride that they're offering you. Having these emotions and being able to express them freely is a great gift. Don't try to hide or suppress anything you feel. If it seems like you're on a roller coaster today, don't try to jump off halfway through the ride. You'll be much safer if you stay seated until the end.",1,cancer,2018
30,"A festive event takes place in your home today, Cancer. Is it a family member's birthday? A lot of lighthearted banter takes place alongside intense discussions of deep subjects and stories of strange events occurring around the world.

1,"Your extremely overpowering emotions are apt to scare people off today, Cancer, especially when it comes to matters involving intimate relationships.

Let someone else take the lead today and you may be quite pleasantly surprised at where you and this special person end up.",2,cancer,2018
2,"Today is a great day for transformation, Cancer, and your actions have deeper than usual inner meaning. Be careful where you aim your arrow, because the tip of it has extra sting today.

Make sure you don't hit anyone when the lid flies off.",2,cancer,2018
3,"Is someone you know having a birthday, Cancer? If so, beware of all the great food that will undoubtedly be brought to the party! If you're trying to improve your level of health and fitness, you'll be sorely tempted to depart from the program.

Enjoy a little bit!",2,cancer,2018
4,"Feeling the effects of today's energies, Cancer? Take heart if this is the case, because the end of the tunnel isn't as far away as it seems.

Slowing down will likely elude you and you’ll have to find one means or another to express what's racing around in your head. The aspects today lend much to communication. Perhaps talking over your writing or ideas with someone whose insight you value will do the trick. Even doodling can give you a place to put your thoughts. Explore these activities today.",2,cancer,2018
7,"Try to make sure you get some quality time to yourself today, Cancer. Your nature is one that thrives on intense thought, creativity, sexuality, and emotion.

Such things as irritability or withdrawal can be strong indicators that it's high time you were alone with yourself. Make some plans for this today.",2,cancer,2018
8,"You might be feeling a bit more hesitant than usual when it comes to making decisions, Cancer. Even if someone accuses you of being distrustful, it's your sense of caution that saves you a lot of grief. If a person or situation has you feeling skeptical, there is probably a good reason for it. Examine what you need in order to feel comfortable, but not to the extreme that you deny yourself opportunity.",2,cancer,2018

This definitely boosts your ego, your mood, and your motivation.",2,cancer,2018
12,"A goal related to business or finance that is very important to you could require you to pay a lot of attention to paperwork today, Cancer. You're likely to spend most of the day on it since a deadline may be involved. Take care, however, that you don't get so caught up in a quest for perfection that you stress yourself out. Sometimes obsessive attention can sabotage the very aim you're working toward. Stay focused and pace yourself.",2,cancer,2018
13,"Things that require restriction and discipline on your part may be causing tension and opposition in your world today, Cancer. The good news is that your mind is clear and you should feel in tune with the people around you. Know your allies and take care of them. Remind others of how much they mean to you. The most important aspects of your life are your friends and family, so treat them with unconditional love.",2,cancer,2018
14,"A member of your household is likely to be in a very strange mood today, Cancer. This person has heard some news that is confusing and probably untrue and therefore is wondering what effect this would have on their situation. If he or she discusses it with you, the best advice you could give would be to not panic until there's a chance to check the facts. The truth is probably a lot different from what you've all heard.",2,cancer,2018
15,"Someone in the know could come to you today with opportunities for increasing your income, Cancer, perhaps involving investments of time or other resources in new business enterprises. These possibilities are worthy of consideration, yet you need to be particularly businesslike and consider all the ins and outs and pros and cons before committing to anything. One prospect may be just what you want, while another might turn out to be entirely different. Give it some thought!",2,cancer,2018
16,"Today some information might come your way that inspires you to come up with some valuable new ideas, Cancer. Your own intuitive faculties are operating at a very high level, and therefore your insights could prove valuable. Make sure you cover every possible contingency. This knowledge could be used to advance your own career and financial interests, so you may want to spend an hour or two writing down your thoughts.",2,cancer,2018
17,"Some minor money matters may need to be handled today, Cancer, and you might find this irritating as you probably have other things you'd rather do. The situation could cause some petty friction with family members, but that will pass. However, you'll be able to muster all your innate skills and get the money matters handled, which will leave the rest of the day to do what you want. Hang in there.",2,cancer,2018
18,"You could be feeling a bit flush today, Cancer, and therefore you might decide to do a little work on your house. This is more likely to be redecorating than any major repairs, as you’re more into beauty right now than practical matters. Your aesthetic sense is very high, inspired from the higher realms, and therefore decorating decisions you make today are likely to be beautiful. Go to it!",2,cancer,2018
19,"Travel may cause more problems than it's worth today, Cancer. You may forget some vital items when packing or there could be too little time to get everything ready. Your plane could be delayed or something valuable lost. Try to short-circuit potential problems. Use a checklist when packing, keep valuables close to you, and take lots of books and CDs in case you have to wait out a delay. In spite of it all, have fun!",2,cancer,2018
20,"By nature you’re a master psychologist, Cancer and you don't need to know someone well to accurately assess his or her thoughts and motives. Today this ability goes far beyond psychology and borders on the psychic. People's feelings may jump out at you. Reading newspaper headlines gives you uncanny ideas about the future. You could also experience some intense and vivid dreams. Make a careful record of the symbols in your dreams. You’ll be surprised at what they tell you.",2,cancer,2018
21,"Have you been invited to a party that's supposed to take place today? If you think you haven't, Cancer, you'd better check your calendar again. All signs suggest that you could forget a lot of important things right now and one might be a social event, perhaps business related. This might not be one of your best days. Usually you tend to have a memory like an elephant. Just for the time being, keep your calendar handy!",2,cancer,2018
22,"Your neighborhood is changing, Cancer, and the change is all for the better. Wonderful new neighbors may have moved in, or perhaps a small gourmet take-out shop has just opened up. It all adds to the sense of warmth and community of your town. You spend a good part of the day among your neighbors, encountering them wherever you go as you run errands in town.",2,cancer,2018
23,"“The person who dies with the most toys wins” may well be your philosophy, Cancer. And today you certainly move ahead in the race as you add yet another technological wonder to your home. What is it this time? A scanner, digital camera, DVD player, or all of the above? It's a small indulgence for all the hard work you do. If these things really give you such pleasure, then you deserve to have them.",2,cancer,2018
24,"A lack of contact between you and a romantic partner could have you feeling rather depressed today, Cancer. You might be tempted to jump to the erroneous conclusion that your beloved no longer cares about you and that's why your phone isn't ringing. Don't fall into this trap. If you try to be objective, you'll realize that this isn't true. Chances are that your friend was held up in some way and will call as soon as there's an opportunity.",2,cancer,2018
25,"There is passion in the air, Cancer, and you’re convinced that you’re the one electrifying the air around you. To be blunt, you can think of little else but sex today. Perhaps it's a result of working too hard for too long and not taking the time to indulge your sensual side. Well, there's no time like the present. Why not invite a certain special someone for a home-cooked meal? Light a candle, open a bottle of wine, and see what happens.",2,cancer,2018
26,"You’re likely to be feeling especially sensuous right now, Cancer. You exude a sort of innocent eroticism and draw many admiring glances. You’re feeling alive and passionate, eager to embrace your life and the special people in it. This would be a great day to plan a romantic evening at home. Cook a nice meal, chill some wine, light some candles, and let nature take its course.",2,cancer,2018
27,"A family member or other loved one may not be telling you the truth. In this person's defense, he or she likely thinks they're protecting you by shielding you from the truth. This is a time for you to trust your instincts, Cancer. If you're told something that simply doesn't ring true, check the information yourself rather than accept it at face value.",2,cancer,2018
28,"Some rather intense work, perhaps involving in-depth research, could take up much of your time today, Cancer. You could spend a lot of time in libraries or on the Internet trying to discern certain facts that you need for a project that could make a big difference in your income. This can be fascinating and exciting, but there is one caution: remember to rest your eyes from time to time. You won't want to give yourself an eyestrain headache.",2,cancer,2018
1,"Don't be surprised if a lot of uninvited visitors show up today, Cancer. You could host an impromptu social event as neighbors stop by to bring news of changes in the area.

Simply offer whatever refreshments you happen to have on hand and let the party take its course.",3,cancer,2018
2,"Unsafe conditions could exist around the house, Cancer, which may result in accidents if they aren't rectified. Some may not be readily apparent, so warn family members to be careful. This isn't a good day to do any heavy work around the home. If you're planning major repairs, it might be a good idea to postpone them. This is, however, a good day for planning such repairs, as you can be especially methodical right now.",3,cancer,2018
3,"It might be hard to get to the root of a matter today, Cancer. Instead of getting stressed about it, take a long nap sometime this afternoon. Water your plants and read a book. Escape into some sort of fantasyland that takes you away from your daily life. Dealing with people on their own terms may prove extremely difficult. The other party might not be acting from a point of assuredness. Deal with them later.",3,cancer,2018
4,"Upsetting events in the neighborhood might have family members in a funk. This could be something major like construction crews tearing up the streets, or something as minor as a bout of bad weather. No matter, Cancer, it's going to make your lives a bit more difficult for a while, but you'll have to bear with it. In the meantime, try to cheer everyone up by throwing an impromptu party. This always works!",3,cancer,2018
5,"One or more exciting new people could come into your life today, perhaps through friends or group activities of some kind. They might actually visit you in your home.

You might also begin to contemplate a move. Enjoy your day.",3,cancer,2018
6,"Look at things from a more philosophical perspective, Cancer, instead of seeing everything from such an intensely emotional one. You may have a constant fear that everyone is out to get you. More than likely, you're blowing small instances out of proportion in your mind. Use your friends as a sounding board for your thoughts. More than likely, you'll understand the situation better by introducing this fresh perspective.",3,cancer,2018
7,"Your sixth sense is right on target, Cancer, so trust your instincts today. You're likely to connect with someone in a wonderful partnership that will help you foster the very plan you want to develop now. Stay close to those things that resonate strongly with your morals. The answer is in front of you; you don't have to search too far afield in order to find it.",3,cancer,2018
8,"Things could get a bit tense for you, Cancer. One of your first reactions might be to look to your loved ones for support. Unfortunately, you might find that your standbys aren't standing by. In fact, it could seem like they've joined the opposition. You might at first feel like you've been betrayed. In reality, maybe you're fighting for an old cause and it's time to join the opposition, too.",3,cancer,2018
9,"You are passionate by nature, Cancer, but the strength of your desires might surprise even you today. You're feeling especially romantic and even sexier than usual. You'll want to spend time alone with your lover. Don't be surprised if you attract admiring glances from others, even strangers. Communication on all levels should be clear and forthright. Enjoy a great evening!",3,cancer,2018
10,"This is an intense day for you during which the disharmony in different realms of your life crops up and spurs you on to action, Cancer. Others may be ridiculously stubborn today, causing tension and frustration wherever you turn. Fun is the key to balancing out the equation. A jovial frame of mind and playful attitude will help remedy any situation that comes your way. Have a good time today.",3,cancer,2018
11,"There is a negative intensity about the day that is only going to get worse if you continue this stubbornness about every issue that comes your way, Cancer. Much of today's activity will focus on ways in which people can break out of their ruts and see things from an entirely different perspective. If you insist on remaining fixed in your ways, you'll only meet resistance.",3,cancer,2018
12,"Let today serve as a reminder of the importance of love, Cancer. Don't just think of it as a commodity you fight for and conquer with conniving tricks and strategic dating tactics. Realize that love is evident in how you see the world; it's a seed in you. The more you see love in the people around you, even in the heart of a stranger, the more you'll be blessed with its radiant light.",3,cancer,2018
13,"Control is apt to be a big theme for you and the people around you today, Cancer. You'll find such a brutal dispute over who is holding the reins that once someone finally gets a firm hold of them, he or she is apt to take the situation to the extreme. There's an aggressive tone to things that can't easily be ignored. Keep an eye on your associates on a day like this.",3,cancer,2018
14,"You should wake up feeling strong and confident, Cancer. Expect to receive some good news today, which will only heighten your mood. In the afternoon you could attend a party or neighborhood get-together. You'll have a good time talking to friends and meeting new people. In the evening, relax!",3,cancer,2018
15,"As a person who enjoys being gregarious and outgoing, days like this provide a wonderful outlet for your energy. You might spend a lot of time with your family today, Cancer, but you'll also probably touch base with many others. At some point you might find yourself in the spotlight. You'll feel especially fond of everyone around you and appreciate your good fortune. Enjoy your day.",3,cancer,2018
16,"A powerful sense of inspiration could come from within today, Cancer. You might want to write down your thoughts or draw the pictures that pop into your head. However, social obligations, possibly parties or visits, could interfere with putting your ideas on paper. You could also feel especially attuned to the thoughts and feelings of others, although you might not like what you're picking up!",3,cancer,2018
17,"Be careful about becoming too stubborn today, Cancer. This is one of those days in which you're asked to build a structure in a very windy area. If you insist on using the most rigid materials, you'll find that the structure you build ends up snapping in two. If, however, you construct your building with flexible materials, it will bend in the wind and last far longer.",3,cancer,2018
18,"A lot of paperwork involving new plans for your business interests could need immediate attention. Getting it done properly is probably going to require a lot of ingenuity on your part, Cancer, but you'll manage it. Your mind is particularly quick, sharp, and focused today, so you'll be able to accomplish a lot in whatever you try. In the evening, attend a concert, lecture, or other event in your community.",3,cancer,2018
19,"You may find yourself emotionally challenged today by a strong force demanding your attention, Cancer. Your hyperawareness to every situation might be driving you a bit crazy. Perhaps you just need to tone things down and relax. Enjoy rather than question the fun-loving energy of the day. The more you simply let loose and explore, the better off you'll be.",3,cancer,2018
20,"The special person in your life could be working too hard, causing strain for him or her and frustration for you. Their extra hours at work could interfere with your desire to enjoy quality time together. Your own worries could put a damper on your self-confidence, Cancer. You might be wondering if you're doing everything that needs to be done. It might help to make a list and cross off each task you complete.",3,cancer,2018
21,"You might feel that money is flowing out of your bank account all too quickly lately, and this might be a cause of worry for you. You could feel you've spent too much on decorations for your home or on entertaining family and friends. Don't worry! You'll make up for it, and besides, you can't take it with you, you know. Watch your spending, Cancer, but don't turn into a miser.",3,cancer,2018
22,"You may attend a party or other group activity this evening, Cancer. However, you and the special someone in your life could well leave it early in order to steal some time for intimate conversation together. You should be looking and feeling great and be especially optimistic about your future and the future of your relationships. The future is looking extremely bright to you today.",3,cancer,2018
23,"Kicking ideas around with colleagues today could lead to planning social events and bringing important people together in order to ensure cooperation on ambitious projects. You might find yourself in a number of meetings, Cancer, or spending considerable time on the phone. Your mind is especially business oriented today, so you'll be operating very efficiently. However, remember the niceties. Express polite interest in those around you even if you don't feel it.",3,cancer,2018
24,"You could have some paperwork to do today, Cancer, which could make a big difference to your financial future. This could be a contract, settlement, or agreement of some kind.

This can be frustrating, but it's important to do it today.",3,cancer,2018
25,"An invitation to a social event could come today, Cancer, and you probably won't want to go. The people involved may not have anything in common with you, and you'll probably feel the event will be tedious and boring. Nonetheless, there may be business factors involved that could have you thinking you should go anyway. How urgent is the business? How important are the contacts? Think about it before you accept or decline.",3,cancer,2018
26,"Imagination combines with intellectual abilities to enable you to make some creative changes to your home, Cancer. This could be something minor, such as purchasing plants, or a major project, such as remodeling or redecorating. Whatever you choose to do, you're likely to channel a lot of your energy into it right now in order to produce results that you and the other members of your household can be happy with. Have fun!",3,cancer,2018
27,"Passion and romance are in the air, Cancer, so make the most of the great atmosphere! Everyone seems to be in a festive mood.

Be sure to be extra open about sharing your feelings today.",3,cancer,2018
28,"Today you could hold a group meeting of some kind in your home, Cancer. The guests will probably include people in such interesting fields as astrology, metaphysics, environmentalism, and the arts. A love partner could also be present. Some fascinating discussions could take place, supplying you with enough food for thought to last for days. By the time everyone leaves, you could feel bonded far more strongly than when the party began. Enjoy!",3,cancer,2018
29,"Some down-to-Earth conversations with a love partner could result in advancing the relationship to the next level of commitment, Cancer. The communication should be loving and supportive, but practical matters like money, work, and personal habits could be discussed. You'll probably find that you and your partner are more compatible than you thought. Move ahead, but with caution. Love is the beacon guiding most of us through life.",3,cancer,2018
30,"Are you working at home now or perhaps considering it, Cancer? If so, remember that you'll probably enjoy the comfort and freedom it provides. Being in your own territory among your books and pets and wearing your old clothes will feel good. However, in no way will working on your own compromise your work ethic. If anything, you'll get more done than ever. Dig in and go for the gold.",3,cancer,2018
31,"Have you been planning to travel, perhaps for business, Cancer? You might receive word that your trip has to be postponed, which could be disappointing. However, bear in mind that this is only a delay, not a denial. All signs are that you'll make that trip, so don't panic. Think of it as more time in which to prepare. You'll want to be thoroughly ready before you go. Enjoy your day.",3,cancer,2018
1,"Business success may have come your way, Cancer, but today you could find yourself feeling a little sad and wondering why, since there's no real reason to feel this way. What's going on is probably, first of all, a letdown, since your brain is no longer churning out the endorphins. Second, you may be wondering where you go from here. Only you can decide that. Set a new goal and move on.",4,cancer,2018
2,"People are apt to be as stubborn as you in their thinking today, Cancer. This could be a recipe for disaster if you aren't careful. Open the floodgates a bit wider and take in more of the opinions of others. Don't automatically assume that other people have to conform to your viewpoint to resolve an issue. More than likely, there needs to be some give and take from all involved.",4,cancer,2018
3,"Be careful about shutting yourself off from the rest of the world, Cancer. You might hesitate to talk to people. You could have the feeling that they're unworthy of your time. Perhaps you feel that your problems are more important and that others are too concerned with superficial things to understand the true depth of your nature. Isolating yourself certainly isn't going to remedy the situation. You really need to communicate more.",4,cancer,2018
4,"Nurture your loved ones, Cancer. Tonight feel free to escape into a fantasy world with the object of your desire. Make plans to set your wildest fantasy into motion. Let your imagination lead the way. You'll never get where you want to go until you head in that direction. Have confidence that you can turn your dreams into reality. Don't waste another day doing things that don't contribute to your long-term plans.",4,cancer,2018
5,"How hard you have to work to achieve your purposes, Cancer! It's as though you carry around an overstuffed sandbag and each step requires a huge effort! This would be a good day to identify the source of the trouble. Ask if you aren't sabotaging yourself and letting your subconscious resist the goals you have so deliberately set. You have a deep inner mystery to solve.",4,cancer,2018
6,"Are you thinking of switching careers or traveling to the other side of the world, Cancer? Or perhaps you just want to pull a “Greta Garbo” and stay at home alone with the shades drawn tight. A series of small incidents at work is likely to inspire you with the most outlandish of ideas. It might just be that you sense your inner need for a change of scene.",4,cancer,2018
7,"A person with whom you work, probably a woman, could leave suddenly without notice or stated reason, Cancer. This could be confusing, and you might find yourself wondering if there are changes within the company that you know nothing about. Try to learn exactly why this person left. If you can't ask him or her directly, discreetly ask someone who might know. It's important, if nothing else, for relieving your anxiety.",4,cancer,2018
8,"Some vivid, beautiful dreams or visions could awaken you and make you aware of new opportunities. They could be creative in nature, and you should consider taking advantage of them, Cancer.

Your destiny might lie just around the corner!",4,cancer,2018
9,"Today you could have a strong desire to get out and socialize, Cancer. You could well spend a lot of time on the phone trying to reach some friends, but not have much luck with it.

10,"Career and financial goals could seem completely stalled, Cancer, and this could have you depressed, frustrated, and in something of a panic. Don't fall into this trap.

Go to your favorite restaurant, buy yourself a present, or spend the afternoon in a bookstore. If nothing else, you'll feel better.",4,cancer,2018
11,"You might need to make a lot of phone calls and get through some lingering paperwork today, Cancer. A business partner or friend could be instrumental in helping clear up some loose ends that have been left hanging. Be sure you get any leftover work out of the way, because soon you'll probably be even busier. If you get bored, remember that success lies ahead. Good luck!",4,cancer,2018
12,"Happiness reigns in the home as friends and family members gather for a long-awaited reunion, Cancer. Or you could be hosting a gathering of friends and acquaintances interested in the arts or psychic or metaphysical matters. Discussions should be intense but fascinating nonetheless. A young visitor could come up with some unexpected insights and revelations that blow everybody away. Write down whatever impresses you the most. Enjoy your evening.",4,cancer,2018
13,"Your mind is like a sponge today, Cancer, eager to absorb all sorts of information. Take care that the information you're absorbing is accurate. There's a high likelihood that the fascinating news you hear is mostly a mix of fantasy and fiction. Go to the source and get the facts before acting on this information. If necessary, do your own research online or in the library.",4,cancer,2018
14,"You might wake up today feeling a little grumpy and out of sorts, Cancer. You could aspire to nothing more strenuous than spending the day without any distractions other than a good book.

Your creative juices are flowing and you'll want to make good use of them. Writing, painting, and photography are all good choices for today.",4,cancer,2018
16,"This could be a tough day for you emotionally. It might surprise you to find that some very old, deep-seated feelings get churned up in the course of investigating a subject of keen interest to you. It might be difficult to process these feelings. Don't try to intellectualize them too much, Cancer. At the same time, be wary of situations that could trigger an emotional cyclone. Some words can be brutally painful. Try to avoid this at all costs.",4,cancer,2018
17,"You might want to make an extra effort to tidy up the house this morning, Cancer. It's likely that you'll have some unexpected guests. Some neighbors could drop by unannounced, or an old friend could call from her car and say she's on her way over. Take it all in stride. Even though you had a lot planned for the day, it will be much more enjoyable if you spend it socializing with friends.",4,cancer,2018
18,"Today is likely to be another busy one for you, Cancer. You might have a volunteer activity in the morning and then get roped into running errands in the afternoon. It will be busy bordering on hectic, but the hustle and bustle of being out and about is energizing for you. Invite some friends to join you for dinner in the evening to cap off this high-energy day.",4,cancer,2018
19,"Don't be surprised if neighbors come to your door asking for a favor – and not just to borrow a cup of sugar! While your initial response will be to say yes (it's your nature, after all), think twice. This ""favor"" could involve a major time commitment. Is this what you want to do? You can put your needs ahead of your friends' and still be a good neighbor. Don't worry, they'll understand.",4,cancer,2018
20,"Cancer, instead of digging deep into the barrel looking only for the misshapen, bruised, and rotten apples, concentrate on bringing up the shiny, bright red ones. This way you'll bring laughter and smiles to the company around you rather than miserable frowns. Whatever you bring to the surface will be distributed far and wide, so make sure you reach for the good times instead of the sour ones.",4,cancer,2018
21,"A lost object could have all the members of your household going through every room trying to find it, Cancer - probably without success. Visitors could pitch in as well and help with the search. The item is probably in a fairly large room that everybody uses, probably among other objects. If no one locates it, however, let it go for now. It could reappear later as if by magic.",4,cancer,2018
22,"Dreams and visions about your family paint a rosy picture of your future, Cancer. These dreams could well be prophetic, but don't jump to that conclusion without first analyzing the symbols and discerning what your dreams are trying to tell you. There could be something that you need to consider before you can move ahead toward the future you want to create. But remember that dreams can be interpreted in more than one way!",4,cancer,2018
23,"Your sensuality is tempered today with a touch of the mystical sort of romantic feeling found in fairy tales, Cancer. This might be unusual for you, but your current partner is going to love it!

Good luck!",4,cancer,2018

If a deal is valid today, it will still be valid tomorrow.",4,cancer,2018
25,"Just because one person is no longer a part of your life doesn't mean that all people are unreliable. People change, as do situations. It's possible that this person was no longer a healthy influence on you, in which case the departure is for the best. You're going to have to become more adaptable, Cancer, because there are more changes on the horizon, especially where your career is concerned.",4,cancer,2018
26,"Today, Cancer, you'll really be in the limelight. This could help you change what is sometimes a very negative image you have of yourself. You have a certain kind of energy and magnetism about you - it's about time someone noticed! It's only natural that you should be proud of yourself, and that other people should acknowledge your hard work and effort. Revel in this moment of glory!",4,cancer,2018
27,"No doubt you're feeling attractive and passionate today, Cancer. Don't be surprised if a former lover gets in touch with you to try and rekindle the old flame. The attention is flattering, to be sure, but you're unlikely to have any desire to pursue the relationship. You're happy with what you have right now. And as they say, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""",4,cancer,2018
28,"Usually, Cancer, you have pretty good powers of focus and concentration. However, today you might find that these powers are flagging.

Releasing them could reset your concentration back to normal.",4,cancer,2018
29,"Some new ideas for expanding your horizons on some level could come to you today through an unexpected source, Cancer, possibly even dreams or visions.

Some research is definitely called for, and possibly consulting with people in the know. Think about it!",4,cancer,2018
30,"Today you might find yourself the center of attention, Cancer. Friends could ask for some information they know you have. It might involve telling a story or giving practical advice.

Your audience will probably be rapt.",4,cancer,2018
1,"You face a day of some conflict, Cancer. Nevertheless, the discord will prove quite useful. This is probably one of the best opportunities in recent weeks to become aware of some family matters.

2,"Today, Cancer, you can at last express the secrets that have been troubling you. You may be seething with anger inside and afraid to let it show for fear it may explode on contact.

Perhaps you should take advantage of it.",5,cancer,2018
3,"Your feelings may deceive you, Cancer, so be careful of getting too wrapped up in your own drama. Perhaps you feel you're getting pushed and pulled in uncomfortable directions. You might tolerate this tension for a while without expressing your feelings about it. This is a dangerous policy because it could give others the impression that it's OK to continue treating you the way they do.",5,cancer,2018
4,"You might have questions about the satisfaction you feel about your personal life, Cancer. It's possible you have more demands than ever. Things seem so urgent to you now.

It's important to do this before you begin to resent your partner.",5,cancer,2018
5,"A lack of communication with an unhappy family member could have you feeling a little downhearted, Cancer. You might wonder if you've done something to offend this person. Chances are you haven't.

The gloomy mood will pass, so don't make yourself crazy over it.",5,cancer,2018
6,"A date with a significant other could bring up discussions about plans for the future, Cancer.

7,"Relating to people may be difficult for you, since you get the feeling that others don't see things as deeply or emotionally as you, Cancer.

Adopt a more lighthearted approach to life.",5,cancer,2018
8,"Things are coming to a dramatic climax for you in matters of love and romance, Cancer. Perhaps you've been nurturing a relationship. You've put a lot of passion and soul into building a strong connection. This is a time of reckoning in which you take a step back and see what you've gained from it all. Do you have a partner for life or someone who doesn't appreciate you as much as you think they should?",5,cancer,2018
9,"Overall, the forecast for today is fairly good. The aspects seem to favor figuring out the meaning of all that's transpired over the past several weeks.

For some reason, practical problems are easy for you to solve. Don't pay any attention to the idle and ineffective chatter of intellectuals.",5,cancer,2018
11,"Why not go directly to the heart of the problem, Cancer? This could be the question you've been asking yourself concerning a commitment to a cause that's important to you.

In any case, these kinds of leaps of faith tend to occur during days with this kind of planetary energy.",5,cancer,2018
12,"A challenging day is in store for you, Cancer. If you're part of a group or team or simply among friends, you may feel somewhat ill at ease. Could it be that you instill jealousy in others?

13,"Today you might want to spend time visiting friends in your neighborhood, Cancer. Small purchases might be necessary, perhaps new clothes, perhaps objects that improve or add beauty to your home.

Enjoy!",5,cancer,2018

16,"Are you thinking of switching careers, Cancer, or traveling to the other side of the world? Perhaps you just want to pull a “Greta Garbo” and stay home with the shades drawn tight.

17,"You'll find that you have a much better than usual connection with the people around you, Cancer. Your psychic sense is acute, and you should use this sixth sense to pick up things that other people might miss.

19,"It has been fairly easy for you to detect the truth behind the situations you've encountered lately. However, beginning today, your analytical abilities won't be so reliable.

20,"Try not to worry too much today, Cancer. Take care of details and work to get things accomplished. Check things off your list and you'll feel much better about yourself and the direction you're headed. Keep your eyes open and try not to have tunnel vision on every issue.

All the hard work you've put in lately is starting to pay off.",5,cancer,2018
22,"If you find your companions a bit too stodgy, today is the day to jostle them out of complacency. You may enjoy experimenting with a bit of naughtiness. For example, how will the people around you react if you flout certain social taboos, such as talking openly about sex? Since you're comfortable with the subject, why not have fun stretching the limits of convention?",5,cancer,2018
23,"This is your day to shine in many respects, Cancer. The action you take is right on target, so draw back your arrow as far as you can before letting it fly.

24,"Tension may be a bit high in just about everyone and everything you encounter today, Cancer. Some will feel a strong need for stability and discipline.

Try not to take things too seriously.",5,cancer,2018
25,"You're almost certainly in a phase of psychological transformation, Cancer, and there have recently been major changes in your circle of friends and associates.

The key at the moment is to not take on as your own other people's problems.",5,cancer,2018
29,"You mustn't expect any enormous changes today, Cancer. However, the process you began three or four years ago will accelerate slightly.

The path is obvious.",5,cancer,2018

5,"Stress might be getting the better of a household member today, Cancer. This person feels emotionally volatile. The least irritation could set off a temper tantrum.

10,"Your family is encouraging you to reconsider some of your long-term plans, Cancer. In fact, some of your loved ones' needs are changing. But the solutions you come up with may not be enough. Just don't panic. You may need to rethink some of your strategies, especially concerning your relationships with the people closest to you.",6,cancer,2018
11,"Today you will have all the energy you need to deal with long-term family problems. Indeed, you'll probably clash with some of your relatives.

You have the ability to get out of any delicate situation you find yourself in today.",6,cancer,2018
12,"Contact with friends who have traveled widely could have you hankering to take the first plane to a distant place that you've always wanted to visit.

13,"Family members who live far away might be planning a visit, and you could discuss it at some length today, Cancer. A lot of phone calls or emails could be exchanged.

20,"Today, you'll need to come up with the answer to an important question, Cancer. What do you really want?

15,"Was there a task you wanted to have completed by now that was delayed for reasons beyond your control? Don't obsess over it. It isn't your fault, and there's nothing you can do about it.

16,"Today's planetary aspects may have you experiencing a little cabin fever. If you have the urge to go off by yourself for a while, do so. Try a new diversion.

18,"A very loving message could come to you from a woman, possibly your mother. If this is a letter, it may go on for several pages. If it's a phone call, the conversation could last for a long time.

20,Try to be careful of missing the forest for the trees today. You may be concentrating on a detail in your personal or professional life that isn't as crucial to the big picture as you think.

21,"Your mental acuity is high today. A recent innovation of yours could bring you some much-deserved recognition. Your mind is especially sharp at this point, and ideas come thick and fast. You have tremendous talent. If you focus it, you'll make some positive inroads toward building your success.",10,leo,2017
22,"You're competing with someone today as you fight for dominance in a situation. The unspoken battle has begun, and the war won't end until you've successfully claimed your victorious position as ruler of the mountain. Defend your territory if you feel that someone is stepping on it. If you don't make it known that you're the boss, someone else surely will claim that spot.",10,leo,2017
23,"You're swamped with paperwork regarding financial affairs. Bills need to be paid and checks deposited. There may also be a legal paper of some kind to deal with.

24,"Indulge in a day of laughter. Things get much more serious tomorrow, so use today to have some fun before it comes time to get down to business.

25,"Money and creativity are successfully joined today. You might make money from a completed project, or you could receive some money to finance a project.

28,"Matters involving work and home should be going very well. Physically, you're feeling well and strong in spite of your recent overindulgence.

The company of friends and family brings a lot of happiness, as does a romantic encounter.",10,leo,2017
29,"Be careful about taking everything as a personal offense. Others' inconsiderate actions may hurt you emotionally, but they don't have to.

30,"The next task on your road to success may be a pill that's hard to swallow. Perhaps it involves interacting with someone you don't want to deal with.

You're sensitive to this dilemma, and you may feel emotional about it, making you hesitate to go through with the plan.",10,leo,2017
31,"You mustn't expect any enormous changes today. The process you began three or four years ago will accelerate slightly.

Simply ask your question.",11,leo,2017
8,Issues regarding romance could be a big part of the picture today. The scales could tip either way in terms of your success at this game. The decision is up to you. You're probably better off keeping things light and entertaining. Reveal the scope of your passionate and powerful emotions on another day.,11,leo,2017
9,The extreme passion that rules you may meet opposition today as more information appears. Communication may color the scene differently than you pictured in your head.

The human mind and its dark side might be especially interesting to you today.",11,leo,2017
21,Love and romance are in your favor even though roadblocks may keep you from taking full advantage of the situation. You're being much too picky about the type of person you seek.

The combination might produce something of real merit.",11,leo,2017

7,"It may be difficult to focus. The trick is to not take anything too emotionally. Keep things on the light side, and don't get too frustrated if you can't seem to find the tools to dig as deeply as you'd like.

8,"Today the cosmic conditions are great for peak physical and mental energy. You'll be able to take on almost anything. With an added increase to your confidence level, now is the time to take steps toward your biggest goals. Rather than worry about rejection, think, ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained.""

Practical issues will be of primary concern.",12,leo,2017
21,Finding out the truth in a situation is key for you. Today you may want to take things to a higher level and loftier vantage point. This can't happen until all the facts are straight. Remember the promises you make and stick to them with confidence. Your powerful emotions are charged with fiery energy. Don't burn others with it!,12,leo,2017

The only way out is through giving your heart unconditionally.",12,leo,2017

Trust your energy and follow your instincts.,12,leo,2017

For example, any matter that fails to elicit your enthusiasm is probably due for some changes.",12,leo,2017
27,"Once you stop dreaming about having superpowers, you'll feel a lot better. You're not a superhero and you never were. For that matter, no one is.

Perfection isn't demanded of you.",12,leo,2017

Even buying a few flowering plants and some colorful scatter rugs and artwork will make a world of difference. You don't have to spend a lot of money to brighten your home and lift your spirits.

By that time, your friend should have the money.",1,leo,2018

7,"At some point, popularity becomes a burden rather than a blessing. Your bulletin board is cluttered with invitations to lectures and parties, Leo, but your eyes begin to glaze over at the thought of attending all these events.

8,"A close relative may be ill or otherwise troubled, Leo, and you might worry a bit too much today because of a lack of communication from this person.

This way you'll feel more financially secure than you have in the past.",1,leo,2018
13,"Today you might play detective, Leo. Something or someone, perhaps a pet, has gone missing in your neighborhood and you'll be out there leading the charge. The object of your search could prove elusive, but will probably turn up none the worse for wear. The only caution: when searching, don't look too far afield. Whatever you seek is probably no more than a block or two from you. Stay close to home and all should be well.",1,leo,2018
14,"Social events could put you in touch with some exciting new people, Leo. They may either share a current interest of yours or bring you opportunities to expand your interests.

15,"Plans for social events to take place in your neighborhood might have you spending a lot of time on the phone today, Leo. Or you might be running around in the car taking care of various errands. This could involve the healing profession in some way. Whatever it is, you feel especially strongly about it. A current or potential love partner might also be involved with your project. Invite this person to dinner. You'll probably like how the evening ends!",1,leo,2018
16,"Dreams and visions might give rise to the desire to be especially artistic and creative today, Leo. Ideas for new artistic projects could be popping in and out of your head all day, and you might go into a panic doubting that you'll ever have the time to make any of your ideas a reality. At this time, you can only write down whatever pops into your head in order of your own preference. Then work with each in turn.",1,leo,2018
17,"Whatever tasks or chores you may have to perform today are likely to go much more quickly and efficiently than usual, Leo. Your level of common sense is high, as is your physical energy. Success is strongly indicated in any kind of enterprise you take on today, so don't be afraid to try anything, no matter how outrageous it may seem. By the way, don't be surprised if other people come to you for advice.",1,leo,2018
18,"The recent completion of one or more long-term goals may cause you to pause today and consider what you're going to aim for next. Don't be afraid to be more ambitious than before, Leo, because you've acquired an inner power that gives you more confidence and a stronger belief in yourself.

19,"You probably pay a great deal of attention to what other people think of you, Leo. It may often be hard for you to make decisions in delicate situations for fear of being misjudged, even if you know you must. You may run into this dilemma as you go about your day today. Trust your own good judgment. It may be much more important to be decisive today than you can even imagine.",1,leo,2018
20,"It's very difficult for you to reconcile your desire for creativity and originality in your life to the constraints that society puts on you to be an efficient, productive person, Leo. This is one of the great dilemmas facing a lot of people these days. It's as if you have to hide your real personality in order to live up to what other people expect of you. Some advice for today: don't be so hard on yourself. You're only human.",1,leo,2018
21,"Important projects, either job related or personal, might need to be completed today in order to meet a deadline or fulfill a promise. This could require a lot of mental and physical effort on your part, Leo, which could prove somewhat stressful. Others might lend a hand, however.

22,"Today you and your family or a group of friends might spend most of the day out and about, Leo. You might spend the day outdoors, or possibly attend a concert or festival of some kind.

Your relationships appear to be quite secure, as does your career and financial situation. Enjoy your day.",1,leo,2018
23,"Study of religion and spiritual matters could well be of particular interest for you today, Leo. You're likely to discuss your knowledge and beliefs regarding such matters with a close friend, which could prove rather enlightening for both of you. Whatever you learn will prove to be artistically inspiring, so don't be surprised if you find yourself spending some time writing down your thoughts or turning them into pictures. Don't limit yourself!",1,leo,2018
24,"Your opinions are apt to be strong today and you may feel on top of the world, Leo. Remember, however, that there are other people who share the world with you, so don't disregard them as you plow though the day. Expressing your thoughts should be no problem, but expressing your emotions could be a whole different matter. Don't push it if it doesn't feel right to share them with others at this time.",1,leo,2018
25,"Money matters might be weighing on the mind of a close friend or lover and your advice could be sought. A creative project of some kind may require a larger expenditure of money, time, or other resources than you originally thought, and this could have you wondering if you'll be able to continue with it. It might take a little corner cutting on your part, Leo, but you should be able to complete it as planned.",1,leo,2018
26,"Love blossoms today as communication with your beloved is enhanced by an increased understanding on both your parts, Leo. You feel more at ease in each other's presence, and you project a united front in the company of others. At some point, both of you will probably go out with a group of friends. Expect some exciting and fascinating discussions with the others, which you'll probably continue once you're alone together. Have fun!",1,leo,2018
27,"Because of your well-mannered attitude and socially minded outlook, Leo, you may normally be reluctant to make a stand with an outlandish idea or draw attention with an unusual outfit or hairstyle. Today is a day to be an individual in all aspects of the word. Prove that you are by doing something unexpected that shakes up the crowd. Make yourself stand out above the rest in whatever way feels most comfortable to you.",1,leo,2018
28,"A partner, either your life partner or a colleague, is likely to be in an irritable mood today, which you could find a bit upsetting. Bear in mind that this person's mood probably has little if anything to do with you, Leo, or anything you've said or done. Just stay out of their way until they're over it! This isn't a good day to give or attend social events or even accept invitations. Wait until tomorrow!",1,leo,2018
29,"Today is one of those days in which you just want to lie on your back on the ground and look up at the clouds, Leo. Your artistic mind can easily spot one that looks like a dragon, one that is a chair, and one that looks just like your mother. Pull someone down onto the grass with you and show that person what you see. There is a reason why your brain draws attention to certain shapes and not others. Find important clues in this information.",1,leo,2018
30,"Your neighborhood is a busy place today, Leo. Perhaps a public gathering of some kind is happening, maybe social, political, or humanitarian in nature. A number of your friends should be there. You might drop by with your romantic partner, out of curiosity more than anything else. Stick around for a while. You could learn something and discover a cause that could mean a lot to you.",1,leo,2018

Find this connection by immersing yourself in the things that you love to do the most.",2,leo,2018
2,"Use today's powerful energy to cut to the heart of the matter and strip away the façade that’s currently doing more harm than good. Open yourself up to the world, Leo, and show the people around you that you have a great deal more to offer than you’ve been revealing. Take a controlling role in the situation at hand and let your needs be known. You’ll find that your daily life will improve tremendously when you communicate your needs.",2,leo,2018
3,"Are you into abstract art forms, Leo? Today you could find yourself irresistibly drawn to them, whether blank verse, abstract painting, or New Age music. If you're into the arts yourself, you might want to try your hand at whatever discipline appeals to you the most. If you aren't, attend a concert, stroll through an art gallery, or go to a poetry reading. Whatever you do, enjoy your day!",2,leo,2018
4,"Consider making some plans for a vacation or short getaway, Leo. Looking forward to something fun can make even the toughest of days far easier to handle. You'll be amazed how much you can manage when there's an end in plain sight. Your entire attitude can lighten. So take the bull by the horns and create an incentive for yourself. Do something special to reward the hard work you do day after day.",2,leo,2018
5,"It won't be surprising if you find yourself getting frustrated with a close friend or partner today who is far less ambitious than you, Leo. The energy in the air can really emphasize your “go, go, go” way of reaching goals and achieving success. Others who are passive or fearful in this area may be difficult to understand. Yet each person has to do things in ways that are best for him or her. Try to be patient.",2,leo,2018
6,"Welcome to another great day, Leo. The energy from the day's aspects is positive and encouraging when it comes to communication and interaction with others. Why not take advantage of this?

You work hard all the time, so play hard today!",2,leo,2018
7,"Today may be a good day for you to spend some time creating, Leo. While you may love sports, you also have an innate artistic streak. The joy of creating something is immeasurable, and the process of producing a finished product can be very enjoyable and therapeutic. Crafts, baking, building, and gardening are all activities conducive to this. Take time to express yourself through your favorite hobbies today.",2,leo,2018
8,"You may feel that you have to defend your motives today, Leo, and this can really put you off, especially if you can't see a reason for it. Try not to take it personally. Just because you know where you're coming from doesn't mean the other person does. It may simply be a communication problem. Make the effort to clarify your position. If this doesn't suffice, it isn’t your problem any more. The other person will have to look at his or her trust issues.",2,leo,2018
9,"It's a great day to explore your creativity, Leo. This probably isn’t a new thing for you, since you’re artistic. Staying focused on one thing can be another story, though.

Have fun expressing yourself and creating!",2,leo,2018
10,"An opportunity to travel could come your way today, Leo, perhaps in the company of friends or colleagues. This might involve education in some way.

Another opportunity like this might not come around for a while.",2,leo,2018

Hold off on spreading the word until you can inform those closest to you. You'll need and want their support.",2,leo,2018
12,"The establishment of a new business partnership could require a lot of paperwork today, Leo. It might be really tedious trying to make sense of all the jargon involved, but it's important to you, so you're likely to be more persistent than usual. Someone more familiar with these matters could explain the ins and outs to you. This is likely to be a very fortunate development for you, so don't lose heart. Hang in there!",2,leo,2018
13,"Your internal fire may be feeling a bit smothered by a fierce reality check today, Leo. Give people the benefit of the doubt. They are more perceptive than you may think. In fact, it may behoove you to get some honest feedback today from some people you trust. It could be difficult for you to sort out the truth in your present situation, since you’re the one caught in the middle of the maelstrom. Consider the perspective of another.",2,leo,2018
14,"Attempts to contact others in different states or foreign countries today could go awry, Leo, as technology that we tend to take for granted, such as telephones and the Internet, could malfunction, perhaps due to solar flares. There isn't much point in making yourself crazy, as this is beyond human control. The only thing you can do is wait! In the meantime, do something else that you love.",2,leo,2018
15,"If you've been thinking about starting a new business partnership, Leo, this is the day to take some positive action toward that end. Any new business enterprises started today, particularly involving partnerships, show a lot of promise for success.

16,"Your intuition, physical and intellectual energy, and insight are at an all-time high today, Leo. You'll probably want to spend much of the day alone, reflecting on your ideas and deciding how you want to put them to work for you. At some point, you may want to put your thoughts in writing. You could also tune in more strongly than usual to the thoughts and feelings of others.",2,leo,2018
17,"The healing of a temporary rift with your partner is likely to take place today, with a lot of honest communication and more apologies than are necessary. You might find that a lot of issues have come out in the open and that there is a new understanding between the two of you. A move could be coming up, Leo, or at least changes within the household you have now.",2,leo,2018
18,"You’re feeling especially psychically and mystically inclined today, Leo. You might want to read about such matters or attend a lecture or workshop given by someone in the field. Telepathic communications are coming your way. Don't be surprised if more than once during the course of the day you and another say the same thing at the same time. You might also experience a powerful kinship with people from the past.",2,leo,2018
19,"Finances may cause an upset between you and a friend today, Leo. Perhaps this person owes you money and can't pay it back, or vice versa. If this is the case, try to work out some kind of arrangement that suits you both. There's always a way to create a win-win situation if you don't both get so angry that your objectivity is totally wiped out. Stay calm and focused and all should be well. Hang in there.",2,leo,2018
20,"An emotional issue with a family member could have you wanting to run away and hide, Leo. Don't fight the urge. This may be just what you need in order to clear your mind regarding the problem and heal your wounded psyche before you face this person again. You might also receive some rather disconcerting revelations about yourself and old traumas that you’ve long since forgotten. Don't fight these either. Simply release them.",2,leo,2018
21,"Too much mental or physical exercise could have you feeling a bit burned out today, Leo. You could be considerably slower on the uptake than usual, and those around you could be surprised that you, normally very energetic, seem to be moving like a snail. Spend as much time resting as you can, because you'll need to recoup your stamina. If you must work, concentrate on routine tasks requiring very little conscious effort.",2,leo,2018
22,"Financial prosperity is just around the corner, Leo, especially with your recently acquired money-management skills. It’s likely that you’ll receive a windfall in the near future, although it may not seem like a windfall to you, since you’ve been expecting this money for a long time now. Use your new abilities to invest it soundly and wisely. You’re bound to be quite pleased with the results you achieve over the long term.",2,leo,2018
23,"Today you could sit down at the computer for just a minute to research something on the Internet and wind up spending most of the afternoon entranced by what you're reading, Leo. You could very well stumble upon some information on the occult and mysticism. It’s always fascinated you, and now that you've begun learning, you don't want to stop. Perhaps you could enroll in a workshop and mingle with others who share a similar interest.",2,leo,2018
24,"You tend to be very intuitive, Leo, but today your channel to the other side could appear to be totally blocked. You can't sense what others are feeling, and oracles like the I Ching just don't make sense any more. You may try to fall back on logic, but that doesn't work today either. Don't think this is a permanent situation, however. Your mental biorhythms are low. You should be back to normal in a few days.",2,leo,2018
25,"You have an innate psychic ability that only needs some fine-tuning and strengthening for it to develop into a formidable power. Even now you sometimes find yourself reading other people's thoughts. This sensitivity gets you into trouble sometimes, but mostly it works to your advantage. In relationships, especially, you’re able to put an end to hurt feelings before they evolve into something irreparable.",2,leo,2018
26,"Try not to let yourself get sucked into participating in idle gossip, Leo. There will be rumors flying today, and you’d be well advised to take cover. While it’s true that there is some truth to the gossip, the embellishments to the story have blown everything out of proportion. Feelings are likely to get hurt. If you don’t want yours to be among them, steer clear of the water cooler.",2,leo,2018
27,"You have an active mind and an even more active imagination, Leo. Today you risk short-circuiting your brain as you struggle to keep up with all the ideas and information swirling inside your head. Take a few minutes to do a mental inventory. Write down everything you're thinking right now so you can free some space in your brain for other issues. A long walk or jog would help soothe your mind.",2,leo,2018
28,"Today, Leo, you could direct an overwhelming amount of love and passion toward a current or potential romantic partner. Your friend might feel a little taken aback, but is likely to be flattered and therefore respond in a positive manner. This might not have the potential to become a committed relationship, so don't expect anything from it. Just get to know each other, see where the bond takes you, and go with the flow.",2,leo,2018
1,"You can expect to run a lot of errands today, Leo, even though you would probably prefer to stay at home. You have obligations to fulfill for friends and family, and you can't bear to let them down. Try to get everything done as quickly as possible so that you'll still have the afternoon free for yourself.",3,leo,2018
2,"Leo, one or more of your co-workers could appear to be rather upset or depressed on the job today, and this is likely to affect your own efficiency. Your colleagues in question aren't going to be very much into communicating, so it's best just to turn a blind eye and keep on working in spite of the situation. It's going to be tougher than usual, but it's nothing you can't handle.",3,leo,2018
3,"Enjoy a spirited day in which you indulge in everything your heart desires, Leo. Your imagination could take you to a whole new realm in which you play the starring role. Live these fantasies. Remember that if you can dream it, you can do it, so think big. The fire inside you burns brightly, so make good use of this power before it's squandered away by someone else tugging on the strings.",3,leo,2018
4,"Today you might hear a rather distressing rumor about one or more people you know or perhaps about your working situation. Don't be surprised if more than one person phones or emails to fill you in on this. However, Leo, this information might not be dependable. It could be based on innuendo or even outright lies. Try to track down the facts before you make yourself crazy over it.",3,leo,2018
5,"Today is likely to prove very busy, Leo, and full of interesting, unusual developments. You might find yourself having to run a lot of errands in your neighborhood, perhaps also making a few short visits. A lot of letters and phone calls, some with intriguing news, could also be on your agenda at this time. It could take some time for you to process all the information and make sense of it.",3,leo,2018
6,"This is your day, Leo, so don't waste it. Being the helpful, friendly person you are, you may find yourself catering to other people's needs and desires. Some could see you as the good Samaritan who can offer advice with a friendly attitude. Be careful of draining away all your energy on others. This day might be better spent by catering to you. Even though this seems selfish, you'll love yourself for it.",3,leo,2018
7,"Take a break from your routine, Leo. You might feel like you're leading an army into battle as you strive for new adventures and conquer new realms.

Use this moment of stillness to form your plan of attack so you're sure about how to proceed.",3,leo,2018
8,"Parts of your life might seem like gladiatorial games out of ancient Rome. The good news is that if anyone can rise above this situation and see the truth in the matter, it's you, Leo. Be careful to not be too obstinate about how to resolve things. This is likely to get you deeper into a mess that you shouldn't have to deal with in the first place. Your job is to mediate not dictate.",3,leo,2018
9,"Communications with family members and others should be clear, honest, and loving. Although your physical passions may be surging beneath the surface today, Leo, they're still very much present. You're likely to be feeling particularly romantic, and might want to read racy novels or go to a sexy movie. This is the night to be alone with that special person. Make sure you look your best. Have fun!",3,leo,2018
10,"You may find it difficult to take action on any practical matter today, Leo. If you find this is the case, don't bother pressuring yourself into making it happen. Today you're more concerned with the fanciful side of life. Daydreams can be a wonderful escape for you today. Do something that will take you out of your current frame of mind. Go see a movie or play this evening.",3,leo,2018
11,"Whether or not you willingly participate, you'll certainly play a key role in the action, Leo. At times you'll feel like the pivotal player whose actions decide the fate of the game. Now you must close your eyes, take a deep breath, and find the answer from your heart. Don't look to others for support, because they'll have their own agendas and ideas about what you should do. Only you know what is best.",3,leo,2018
12,"You may be feeling a strong sense of guilt now because of something you did in an effort to feed your ego, Leo. Be aware of how your actions have affected others and apologize. Guilt is basically a useless emotion that you should get rid of as quickly as possible. Don't let this feeling keep you from opening up your heart to restore it to its original innocence.",3,leo,2018
13,"In general, things should be going extremely well for you today, Leo, so don't miss this opportunity to pursue your dreams in every sense of the word. Do things with passion and don't hold back.

There's a great deal of magnetism at your disposal today, so enlist others to help you.",3,leo,2018
14,"Your outgoing and jovial nature is intensified today, Leo, and so you're probably going to be sought after for any parties or celebrations.

Think about taking your partner with you as you make the social rounds tonight and making him or her the star of the evening.",3,leo,2018
15,"This is a great time to take advantage of a little solitude to pursue some cherished goals, Leo. Your concentration and imagination are operating at a very high level, and you may not stop working until you're completely finished. If you're starting a project, you'll probably do well on it and, if business and money are involved, be successful. Don't let temporary snags get in your way. Go for the gold!",3,leo,2018
16,"Group activities could take up a lot of your time and energy today, perhaps too much. Your career concerns are very much on your mind, and you don't like being distracted from them. Nonetheless, these activities, not to mention your family, are important to you, Leo, and you'll find a way to squeeze them in even though it's frustrating. Remember, this isn't a good day to push yourself too hard!",3,leo,2018
17,"It's a good thing you have a flexible attitude, Leo, especially today. Your adaptive powers could be put to the test as you find yourself surrounded by fickle emotions and stubborn attitudes. Don't get too hung up on getting straight answers from people today, for they're apt to be just as confused as you about certain issues. Play it cool for now and ride the waves easily to shore.",3,leo,2018
18,"A new business opportunity may come your way, Leo. You aren't likely to want to commit to a permanent involvement, but you might take it on temporarily simply for the sake of the money.

It's key that you learn how to address these issues yourself instead of relying on other people to take care of these needs for you today.",3,leo,2018
20,"Today you might try to continue or complete a creative project of some kind, but your imagination just isn't working the way it normally does. Also, overindulgence from last night could have you feeling a bit sluggish, which doesn't help the situation. Put your work aside before you give up on it completely, Leo. This is only a temporary situation. Your mind should be back to normal tomorrow.",3,leo,2018
21,"This will be a good day for you, Leo. You should be feeling happy, excited, enthusiastic, and optimistic about the future. Relations with family, friends, and neighbors are likely to be warm and congenial. Today could involve a lot of time on the phone or out running errands.

Don't expect it right away.",3,leo,2018

Some new discoveries that you may have heard about in the media could have piqued your interest and might propel you to the library to find books on the subject. This is a good time to pursue this. Your mind is in the right space to understand it, and it could shed a lot of light on those around you, including you!",3,leo,2018
25,"Are you feeling a little under the weather, Leo? You may have been burning the candle at both ends. The obvious tip would be to slow down, but you might feel it isn't possible now.

31,"A proposed get-together with a love interest might have to be postponed until much later tonight or perhaps another evening, %. This could make you a little blue. Your insecurity might even get the better of you. Does your friend not want to meet? Don't fall into this kind of thinking. Accept that there's a reason and go with the flow. You'll enjoy the date that much more for the delay.",3,leo,2018
1,"Today you could feel torn between the desire to get a little exercise and a powerful inclination to curl up in your favorite chair and catch up on some reading, Leo. There isn't any reason why you can't do both. Go out for a brisk walk and then reach for a favorite book when you return. The key isn't giving up on one, but attaining a balance between the two.",4,leo,2018
2,"You could find yourself staring at a stranger for just one extra second as you pass on the street today, Leo. Your tendency toward the new and bizarre is stronger than usual, and you're being pulled into different mental directions. Go ahead and introduce yourself to that stranger. Perhaps he or she will become a business partner or new best friend. You never know until you ask.",4,leo,2018
3,"You might talk as if you possess many lifetimes of wisdom, Leo. Perhaps you do, but that doesn't mean you should be arrogant about it. Your words might have the tone of a sage schooled in every subject. As a result, you could grow frustrated with others who act immature or uneducated. It isn't your job to judge. Help others understand the bigger picture instead of assume they're unworthy or unwilling to learn.",4,leo,2018
4,"Regardless of your situation, Leo, you'll want to take the easy way out. There's a laziness sweeping over you, and you could be trying to find a way to sneak out of some responsibilities. Even if this idea seems terrific now, it's likely to get you into some trouble later. Be wary of cheating the system and then expecting the full benefits of hard work in return. You'll earn exactly what you deserve.",4,leo,2018
5,"You could have an urge to invent new things, Leo. You feel compelled to create something in the artistic, technical, or philosophical field. If only you'd give yourself enough time to pursue these ideas! Today, realize that concentration is the key to accomplishment. Put away periodicals, computers, phones, and other such distractions and you might well be surprised by the wealth of inspiration that comes to you.",4,leo,2018
6,"You're likely to find people somewhat irritating today, Leo. It's as though nothing is good enough, and nobody seems to know exactly what he or she wants. You'll reign supreme within this maze of overt conflict and dissatisfaction. You might even be asked to step in and restore order. If the conflict is domestic, go ahead. But tread carefully if you're asked to be the sheriff at the office!",4,leo,2018
7,"Someone you've wanted to hear from for a long time, perhaps an old friend who lives far away, could ring you up today while you're out, Leo. You'll be happy to get the message, but it could result in a frustrating game of phone tag throughout the day. Don't get so irritated you give up. Keep trying. You'll eventually touch base, and you'll be glad you did!",4,leo,2018
8,"Today you might decide to attend a group activity that is primarily concerned with an intellectual, philosophical, or spiritual interest of yours, Leo. You might meet a charismatic person whose conversation stimulates your mind and causes you to come up with new insights. During the course of the day, you might notice that this person is very appealing to you, and you could imagine getting romantically involved at some point.",4,leo,2018
9,"Today you could receive an invitation to a social event that you'll really want to attend, Leo. People could be there who might turn out to be important contacts. Nonetheless, you might find that other responsibilities interfere with your plans, and experience a wave of disappointment. If you're creative, you will find a way to fulfill your obligations and attend the event, too. Think about it!",4,leo,2018
10,"A colleague could be in a very bad mood, Leo, and therefore not the easiest person in the world to deal with. In fact, today he or she could resist working at all, and you might feel obligated to take up the slack. Only do it if the tasks are urgent. It isn't fair to you to have to do someone else's job. Don't feel guilty if you leave it unfinished.",4,leo,2018
11,"If you've been worrying about having spent too much recently, Leo, the astral configuration indicates you should be able to put those worries behind you. There are plenty of opportunities that could bring increased income, possibly a new job, even a new career. A lot of phone calls, emails, or other communications could bring news of these possibilities your way. Be sure to record the ones that seem most promising.",4,leo,2018
12,"Group activities, perhaps with a social, ecological, or humanitarian focus, could take place today somewhere in your neighborhood, Leo. You might decide to attend with your romantic partner. You could encounter some friends in the process, and all of you could well be caught up in the excitement generated by those in the spotlight. Listen well and think about what you learn today. It might make a difference in your future.",4,leo,2018
13,"If you aren't careful, there's a strong possibility that you'll overindulge today, Leo. Your career frustrations may manifest in the form of overeating, excess drinking, or reckless spending. These are just symptoms masking the real problem. If you can take some time to meditate, you'll calm your nerves and reveal the root of your frustration. Once you have the facts, it will be easier to devise an effective solution.",4,leo,2018
14,"Some pretty heavy soul searching could reveal that the time has come to make use of a talent you may have always had but never developed. This could involve nothing more than a little practice, or you could decide to get some formal training in the skill. This is a positive sign, Leo, but your determination could waver over the next few days. Don't hesitate - stay with it!",4,leo,2018
15,"Travel is in store today, Leo. It could be a spur-of-the-moment trip with a friend. More likely, it will be a series of short trips closer to home. You could visit friends or take advantage of sales and do some shopping. Your active mind will pick up on all sorts of ideas for improving your home. Once the errands are done, go home and look at your space with a fresh eye. There is a lot you can do to improve it.",4,leo,2018
16,"Things could be up and down for you today, Leo. You might experience some confusion as a result of communication snafus or computer glitches that affect financial issues you're trying to solve. Persevere and you'll succeed. Don't be surprised if you're recruited to join a project that is totally new to you. You may be apprehensive at first, but you'll do just fine. Go ahead and say yes.",4,leo,2018
17,"You'll have to let go of your usual drill-sergeant manner and simply let the day unfold as it will. Try as you might, even you won't be able to direct events today, Leo. You could find your attention diverted from one project to another. It isn't an unpleasant day but a disjointed one. Stay open to all possibilities. You could be surprised by the way things turn out.",4,leo,2018
18,"You have a strong spirit of cooperation today, Leo. It inspires you to pitch in and help others without being asked. Your romantic partner could be surprised to see you show up and help with a chore. Never mind that you don't know what you're doing - you'll figure it out. Others will be impressed to see you going above and beyond what you've been asked to do. Your efforts on all fronts won't go unnoticed.",4,leo,2018
19,"You're likely to wake up today with a compulsion to clean or organize something, Leo. This may be rather unlike you. If we didn't know better we'd say that you were feeling a parental urge, and your nesting instinct is kicking in. Indulge your domestic desires today. Tomorrow you're probably going to be in quite a different frame of mind!",4,leo,2018
20,"Today there are many areas in which you can shine, Leo. You need only be yourself to win over the hearts of others. There is a graciousness to your manner that draws people close to you, whether or not you've ever noticed it before. Realize this, and know that it isn't a fluke. You need not take much action. It will come to you.",4,leo,2018
21,"This could be a very busy day in your community, Leo. Some kind of rally, protest, or other public gathering might take place. If you attend, you may not hear much because of all the noise, and the event could seem disorganized at best. It could also render traffic impossible! If you can, stay home today. Going out could be more trouble than it's worth. Protest with your vote or your wallet instead.",4,leo,2018
22,"Tonight you might decide to attend a social gathering held in your community that involves a lot of people who are into psychic or spiritual matters, Leo. This should be an interesting experience for you, because you could not only glean a lot of fascinating information but also make some new friends. Someone could recommend a few intriguing books. Keep your eyes and ears open, and take your address book with you. Have fun!",4,leo,2018
23,"A desire to spruce up your home might start with a thorough cleaning from attic to basement, Leo. You could go through that chore like gangbusters and then do some repairs or go for the fun stuff, such as redecorating with plants or even some new furniture. You can have a lot of fun with this, especially if your partner or friends help out. Work hard and enjoy your day!",4,leo,2018
24,"Today would be best spent alone behind closed doors, if possible. There's a lot of tension in your household for some reason, Leo. Since there isn't much you can do about it, try to avoid it altogether. Let your family members fight it out among themselves. You have better ways to spend your time. Why not take in a movie? When you go by yourself, you don't have to share the popcorn!",4,leo,2018
25,"It can be hard to release old habits and beliefs even as new, better ways of thinking struggle to gain a foothold. It's time for you to do this, Leo. You might find it difficult to confide your feelings to another, but a frank conversation with close friends will do much to ease your mind. There's no question that you're changing. Your friends will show you that this transformation is positive.",4,leo,2018
26,"If you've been feeling a little under the weather, today's planetary configuration will make you feel a whole lot better, Leo. In a few days you'll have the strength to pick up where you left off on the projects you perhaps began last month. A lot of things are changing in your life. Your motivations are evolving and your ambitions could be taking a different direction.",4,leo,2018
27,"As you get older, you're drawn more and more to spiritual matters, Leo. It isn't so much that you're embracing any particular religion, more that you're quite curious about the supernatural and some of the ancient arts. Take some time today to visit the library or bookstore and do some reading on the subject. You might want to form a study group with other like-minded individuals.",4,leo,2018
28,"A strange person promoting him- or herself as a mind-reader of sorts could come onto the scene today, Leo. This person, however, is more mixed up than mindful. Therefore, take any predictions with a grain of salt, if not the whole shaker. Chances are good that none of them have any basis in reality. Trust your intuition. Your insights should be far more dependable than those of the so-called psychic.",4,leo,2018
29,"Ideas for a new enterprise, which could be anything from a party to a vacation to a new business, could have you spending a lot of time on the phone today, Leo. You'll need to consult with people who know about what you want to do and at least lay the groundwork for making solid arrangements. Some of what you hear may be confusing, but don't be afraid to ask for an explanation. Go to it!",4,leo,2018
30,"Today you might take up some sort of occult study, such as astrology, numerology, or alchemy that seems like Greek to you at first, Leo. As a result, you could be tempted to abandon it. Don't! Once you get past the jargon, you'll probably find it fascinating. Keep a dictionary handy, and don't worry if you have to go over something several times. You have the brains to do it. Now just put in the time.",4,leo,2018
1,"If you admit you've made a mistake, people are more likely to forgive you. You have a confrontational day ahead, Leo. There's no doubt that you're in a stationary position concerning your career. That may be crimping your style somewhat, financially speaking, but you'll make better progress if you assume your responsibility and see your mistakes. However, don't be too critical of yourself! It's all part of the learning process.",5,leo,2018
2,"Your mind is in great turmoil right now, Leo, so it isn't surprising that you can't pay much attention to anything. It's as though your concept of the world has been inexorably changed and you see your love life and career with new eyes. Even so, you feel compelled to pick up the pieces of the past and save them. The day ahead should help you let go of the old world.",5,leo,2018
3,"In some ways, you may feel like a lost soul who isn't quite in touch with your dreams, Leo. Although you feel energetic and boisterous, you might also get the sense that your energy is misdirected and you're being led in the wrong direction. The key for you now is to lead yourself. Cut through everyone else's agenda and follow your internal rainbow. The more you take charge, the happier you'll be.",5,leo,2018
4,"Today is excellent for just letting your intuition guide you, Leo. If you have time, you might want to let your mind go and follow the train of thought wherever it takes you. You could find something out about yourself of which you unaware, something just waiting to be noticed. Remember, your desires are fantasies before they become realties, so dream a little.",5,leo,2018
5,"The promise of a promotion or raise could be on your mind today, Leo. You might try to visualize the next steps and anticipate tasks that take more effort and concentration than you're used to. Don't panic. It's better to not push yourself so hard. Wait a few days until the planets relax a little and just do what you need to do - no more, no less. You'll be successful in the long run.",5,leo,2018
6,"A number of visitors could come to your home today, Leo, and a number of fascinating subjects could come up in the course of your conversation. Some interesting ideas might come directly or indirectly from these discussions. You might want to put them to use formulating plans of action to make your future more fulfilling. Professional, financial, and spiritual opportunities could all open up for you. Go for it!",5,leo,2018
7,"You have a great deal of physical energy, Leo. At times, you may feel as if you have an endless wellspring of power. You're at a climactic point in your yearly cycle, when things are coming to a dramatic apex. Difficulties that pertain to this climax are likely to make you act out in an aggressive manner if things don't go your way. Find a constructive outlet for all this physical energy.",5,leo,2018
8,"For you, Leo, love is like an adventure, crazy sport, or some sort of video arcade game. Lately, you may have been too caught up in the fantasy aspect of it without taking into account the practical nature and nitty-gritty of what it takes to keep a relationship afloat. You might need to take a more realistic view of it now. Be more sensitive to your emotions and honor them accordingly.",5,leo,2018
9,"Have you felt somewhat lost for the past few days? The fog may lift today and enable you to situate yourself at last. You're probably eager to settle a question that has nagged at you and interfered with your judgment. However, you should be patient, especially if it has to do with emotional matters. Try to understand, but don't take immediate action. You'll be more objective beginning tomorrow.",5,leo,2018
10,"Today you should abandon any intellectual pursuits and concentrate on practical problems related to organization and goal setting. You're likely to find perfect solutions within an hour of starting. The heavens are helping you, Leo. Give them some credit for your ingenuity, and waste no time in implementing your plans!",5,leo,2018
11,"Don't let your fear or anger get the better of you today, Leo. You're going to be pushed to the forefront and you may even be forced to make some big decisions regarding the direction of your professional life. Perhaps you've been feeling that it's a little premature to take action, but, frankly, you no longer have any choice. Whether you know it or not, you're ready!",5,leo,2018
12,"Sometimes dreams seem like just that - dreams. Travel, a project, or a new home could be a few of the things you've been trying to accomplish for some time now. Making any one of these dreams come true possibly means jeopardizing relationships. Your dreams could seem particularly unattainable today. Perhaps you must first do some work on your relationships before you can realize your dreams.",5,leo,2018
13,"A chance to earn a small amount of money, perhaps by doing a little extra work at home, could come your way today, Leo. You could hear about it through a friend or colleague. A visitor might come to your home, perhaps to help with something that needs to be done. This promises to be a very exciting day, with a lot of stimulation that could keep you occupied into the night.",5,leo,2018
14,"Today you're unstoppable! You're a very hard worker by nature, and with the current planetary alignment you'll be able to accomplish even more than usual. You have an abundance of energy, more than enough to handle everything that comes your way. Just be sure to use your usual good judgment. Rash decisions, especially those concerning your personal life, could lead to regret later.",5,leo,2018
15,"The topic of the day is knowledge and learning, Leo. Did you study the field you dreamed of? Do you feel ashamed of not having attended such-and-such a school or program? If those sorts of issues are uppermost on your mind, remember that your creativity has little to do with the degrees you hold and everything to do with how you use your skills and knowledge to better the world.",5,leo,2018
16,"You're likely to find people somewhat irritating today, Leo. It's as though nothing is good enough and nobody seems to know exactly what he or she wants. You'll reign supreme within this conflict and dissatisfaction. You may even be asked to step in and restore order. If the conflict is on the domestic front, go ahead. But tread carefully if you're asked to take on the role of sheriff!",5,leo,2018
17,"Be persistent and don't give up the fight today, Leo. It might seem as if you aren't making progress and that it's harder to make decisions about anything. You'll find that other people are just as confused as you. Find a clever way to express what you feel. You can sort the issues out with the help of others as long as you're in touch with your inner state.",5,leo,2018
18,"Be careful not to lose your temper today, Leo. You're chomping at the bit these days, although your daring nature has been reined in by financial and professional constraints. It's useless to entertain grandiose illusions at the moment. Moreover, if you do, you can expect some confrontations. If you're advised to be more conservative, heed the suggestion.",5,leo,2018
19,How intense the past few days have been! You could spend months just reflecting on these recent experiences. But the mood isn't conducive to introspection right now. A change of temper today encourages you to share your life more generously. But with whom will you share it? That may well be the question of the day.,5,leo,2018
20,"Aspects of your life that you've neglected lately might haunt you on a day like today, Leo. Make sure you're keeping up with all your responsibilities. Things may come to a dramatic climax at this time, and you could find yourself at an important crossroads. Nervous energy could cause you to run around frantically in search of the right path. Don't let indecision keep you from getting where you need to go.",5,leo,2018
21,"Give thanks to the people who are most precious to you, Leo. You'll find that words cut to the core issues much more easily. Stabilize your strong emotions and use them as fuel for you endeavors. The key today is to remember those who have helped you along the way. Everyone is a sensitive and loving individual, so treat them as such. Have fun with the people all around you.",5,leo,2018
22,"There is the likelihood that you've been a bit of a loner lately. It's as though you decided to look at things differently from the rest of the world, rejecting the individualistic viewpoint in favor of a more global one. Today, you may achieve a new phase in this process. You may attain some summit of consciousness from which you finally have the ability to forgive!",5,leo,2018
23,"You could be wondering why everyone has to be so serious and emotional all of a sudden. You're likely to be feeling this way, too. Take this as a reminder that there are many different walks of life and not all of them necessarily intersect your path. Those forces are apt to make themselves known in quite a traumatic fashion today. Prepare to defend yourself and your motives, Leo.",5,leo,2018
24,"Remember that you were put here to have fun, Leo, and that happiness is your true destiny. Keep that in mind today, as forces may tend to pull you away from the fun you've been having. There is likely to be a sobering tone to the day that's stubbornly working to rain on your parade. Recognize the need for structure and stability, but don't let it bring you down.",5,leo,2018
25,"You might feel a little worn out right now, Leo, as if you haven't been getting enough vitamins or rest. Or you could feel like you're losing track of issues that are important to you, such as your children's progress in school. You need to slow down a bit whether you want to or not. Today, give top priority to all the commonplace details of your daily life.",5,leo,2018
26,"Motivation must come from within, Leo. The only thing that can pull you out of bed is your inner drive and determination. Too much partying could leave you drained to the point that you don't want to move. Remember moderation. Be good to your body. Go outside and let your thoughts radiate outward like rays of sunshine. Feel the ground beneath your feet.",5,leo,2018
27,"You may have been engaged in a battle with the facts lately, Leo. Perhaps new information has forced you to take a step back as you contemplate the next move in your game plan. Research time is over and now you need to get back into the game with full force. When it comes to delicate issues regarding other people's property, you should make sure to be respectful at all times.",5,leo,2018
28,"You may need to keep your spaceship idle today and perform a safety check for your crew, Leo. Make sure everyone on board is informed of the destination. It could be that you just picked them off the street without really telling them where they'd end up. It's important that you not drag people unwittingly into your world. If they voluntarily give the controls to you, however, that's a different story.",5,leo,2018
29,"The day should be fairly positive, Leo, and you'll begin to feel the faintest hints of a major change beginning. This new phase will last seven months. As it progresses, you'll find greater freedom of expression. You can expect to shift into high gear in subjects you used to avoid. Some friction with siblings is likely to arise in the next few months.",5,leo,2018
30,"Make sure there is an equal amount of give and take in your day, Leo. Sometimes when you love someone, you just want to keep giving and giving in order to demonstrate your incredible love. Be sure that you aren't draining yourself of valuable energy that you need for yourself. Also be sure that the people you're giving to are also giving their fair share in return.",5,leo,2018
31,"Your wacky personality will be appreciated today, Leo, but don't take it too far. Leave room for seriousness to enter the picture. There's a dreamy, cloudy sensation to the day that might make it difficult for you to concentrate on any one thing. If you pretend to know the answer when you don't, you'll only serve to confuse the people around you. The truth will eventually be revealed.",5,leo,2018
1,"You may not feel like you're exactly clicking with anything today, Leo. Adjustments will need to be made either by you or the people you're dealing with for any resolution to come about. Your emotions may feel tied to the ground, yet your mind may want to take off into the stratosphere. Dilemmas between whether to take action or stay passive could leave you paralyzed. Just go with the flow.",6,leo,2018
2,"Today you should be glowing with good health, energy, and stamina, and be doing well at work, whether career, volunteer work, or a personal project. Success should come your way on all fronts, Leo, particularly since you've been working hard. You're finally likely to see the results of past efforts. Success feeds good health and good health feeds success. Make the most of both.",6,leo,2018
3,"Some new people who appear interesting could move into your neighborhood and excite your curiosity, Leo. Spiritual or metaphysical conversations could take place today over the phone or over coffee. The concepts might be deep, exalted, and inspiring, yet bring up more questions than answers. Books on the subject could prove enlightening. You might even want to write down your thoughts or memorialize them in a drawing or painting.",6,leo,2018
4,"Your enthusiasm for group activities and social events is high, Leo. You might want to discuss your ideas with others. However, you could have trouble reaching people you need to speak with. This can be frustrating, but your enthusiasm isn't likely to flag because of it. Keep trying. Eventually you'll accomplish your goal. Whatever you plan today is likely to be gratifying even if the process is difficult.",6,leo,2018
5,"Friends, neighbors, and relatives could be feeling especially stressed out and explosive today, Leo. This isn't a good day to initiate intense communications with them. Keep your talk light and inconsequential. This is a great day to stay home and read, especially since your mind is particularly receptive to unusual ideas. The Internet, videos, and TV documentaries could be most informative.",6,leo,2018
6,"Today you're likely to be more focused than usual on whatever it is you have to do, Leo, whether chores around the house and yard or important projects of your own. Your mind is especially sharp and in tune with your feelings. Dreams and imaginings might prove to be valuable sources of inspiration. At some point, your mind might turn to travel, the acquisition of new knowledge, or both. Enjoy your day.",6,leo,2018
7,"Today could bring a lot of physical activity, possibly including workouts, sports, and dancing, as your energy, enthusiasm, and stamina are all high, Leo. Life may be mentally demanding, too, but you can handle it. Relations with friends and colleagues should be warm, congenial, and full of good-natured banter. You could be exhausted but satisfied with everything you've done by the end of the day.",6,leo,2018
8,"Love and romance are apt to be your primary focus today, Leo. If you're currently romantically involved, expect a wonderfully intense evening with your special someone. If you aren't involved, don't be surprised if someone new and exciting comes into your life, perhaps from another state or foreign country. Your creative abilities are also intensified. Take whatever time you need to memorize the ideas coming your way. You won't want to forget them.",6,leo,2018
9,"Have your friends ever told you that you could be a great teacher? At home, you're the one who's talking all the time. You're almost compelled to make others listen to you. Children are fascinated by your knowledge. Today, Leo, someone might not agree with you and upset you. You'll learn that your lessons can lead to a conversation. Knowledge isn't a one-way street.",6,leo,2018
10,"Without a doubt, your day will have important consequences for the future of your love life. The doubts you may have today, especially concerning your feelings, are likely to push you to think about things before you make any decisions. Should you go back on what you've done or march on with conviction? This is what is at stake right now. Don't be too hasty about things.",6,leo,2018
11,"You enjoy caring for others and you intervene regularly in their lives to guide them. Ironically, today you're the one who needs advice. You'll probably need to get away from it all in order to get a clear view of your own life, Leo. You could even decide to make the necessary arrangements for a trip abroad.",6,leo,2018
12,"Dreams or visions could put you in touch with deep feelings that you may not have been aware of before, Leo. This could enable you to release traumas from your past and give you a new sense of lightness. However, your logical mind is very much at work, so you could use this experience to shed light on others' experiences and help them, too. Whatever happens today is likely to produce noticeable results.",6,leo,2018
13,"Insights shared by a family member could lead to possible ways to increase your income. Expect to handle a lot of paperwork regarding money, Leo, but this is a positive development and definitely should leave you feeling good about your situation. This is a great day to do in-depth research. Your intuition is high and you're apt to see right through superficial appearances to the heart of any matter that interests you.",6,leo,2018
14,"Sometimes we all feel a little lost, Leo. We often want to move mountains and use all our energy and enthusiasm to try to do so. But a few moments later we could feel that all efforts have been in vain. It pays to remember one of the hard facts of life - take nothing for granted. You shouldn't let that keep you from trying to makes changes to things around you. Be vigilant.",6,leo,2018
15,"Unfortunately, today's planetary energy will place you in a rather uncomfortable situation, Leo. You'll be the one having to smooth things over with your group of friends. Try not to impose your point of view. On the contrary, you should try to become more diplomatic and gentle with the people around you. You could also learn a lot by observing how people behave.",6,leo,2018
16,"You generally enjoy philosophy, metaphysics, and other forms of higher thought, Leo, but today you could find yourself almost obsessive about them. You might decide to sequester yourself and concentrate on these concepts. This is a great day to do this, because intellect combines with intuition to enable you to understand and make sense of abstract ideas. You can apply them to your everyday life. Go to it.",6,leo,2018
17,"The value of any investment you may have made in land, including your home, could come into your thoughts today. Whatever time and energy you've put into it is likely to pay off, Leo, and this might make a difference to you when formulating plans for the future. You might spend some time working outside, which should clear your head and enable you to get your thoughts together. A female friend could join you.",6,leo,2018

This newfound strength will give you a great boost.",6,leo,2018
19,"You were once a creature of reason, Leo. For you, everything had an explanation, a reason to exist, and a place in the world. You never missed a chance to share your viewpoint. Then all of a sudden, silence. Perhaps you needed to get some perspective, not necessarily on the things you know, but on how you express that knowledge. Now words have come back into your life and your ideas are more moderate.",6,leo,2018
20,"Your calm will be put to the test today, Leo. Try not to fall into this trap. You should try to show people that you're a thoughtful person and your past experiences have given you wisdom. You don't necessarily have to respond to aggression. However, you shouldn't forget about your own point of view. Try to assert yourself calmly and steadily.",6,leo,2018
21,"A project that you're rather excited about could require some intense solitary work today, Leo. You might sometimes feel as if the walls are closing in on you, but you need to concentrate in order to get the best possible results. You'll also need to take occasional breaks to clear your head. Nonetheless, you're likely to be happy with what you've accomplished by the end of the day. Get busy.",6,leo,2018
22,"The fiery energy of the day is helping you press on with projects you have in the works. Set things in motion now, Leo. Move out of the background and onto center stage. Your rocket is fueled and ready to take off. All you have to do now is ignite the engine. Use the power of your emotions to deliver a boost that will propel you to the stars.",6,leo,2018
23,"The general atmosphere of the day may seem too slow and stodgy for your tastes, Leo. Try not to get bogged down in details. Try not to worry too much. You may find that it's difficult to get any enthusiasm out of people today. You might just want to sit back and take it easy. This is a good day to plan and reorganize. Honor your recent achievements and consolidate all that you've worked for.",6,leo,2018
24,"Be adventurous and strike out into new territory, Leo. Be a pioneer. Work to make some new discoveries in the world. Today isn't a day to worry about consequences. It's a day to get things started. There is a great deal of fiery energy in the cosmos helping you in your quest for the new and fresh. Take the lead and try not to get thrown off course by leeches and party poopers.",6,leo,2018
25,"All continues to go well personally and professionally, Leo. You're feeling strong and vigorous, but you might find that you're a bit vague today. Your mind may not have its usual acuity, and you could be easily distracted. This isn't a good day to start new projects. Try to concentrate on finishing up old tasks and tying up loose ends in order to make this a rewarding day.",6,leo,2018
26,"Too much work and the resulting pressure over the past few days could have you feeling too tired to do anything more, Leo, although your optimism and enthusiasm are still intact. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're dragging a little toward the end of the day. You'll be able to recharge your batteries before tomorrow. In the evening, relax at home with a good book.",6,leo,2018
27,"Today there might be tension in the air with no discernible cause, Leo. Family members could seem preoccupied with problems they can't quite define. Your natural inclination might be to try to cheer them up, but it probably won't work. Don't be too annoyed if they don't respond to your efforts. It isn't them. It's the planets. This is a great day to jog, do aerobics, or otherwise work off tension.",6,leo,2018
28,"Today may be tough for you, Leo. It might seem like nothing is fitting into place. Could it be that you're trying to be someone you aren't? If things aren't working out, don't press the issue. You're better off waiting for a time when you feel more confident about who you are and where you're going. Have a cup of tea and relax. Releasing stress can free your energy for other uses.",6,leo,2018
29,"Today you might feel especially intellectually and creatively inspired, and you could discuss your ideas with others. The process of communication could open new doors in your mind and result in some fascinating insights concerning whatever you're pursuing at this time. Sometime in the course of your conversations, Leo, don't be surprised if you find that one of your friends needs a sympathetic ear. Enjoy your day.",6,leo,2018
30,"Today might be a somewhat difficult day for you, Leo. Instinctively, you'll want to escape the situation and explore your freedom, but something will be holding you back. Take care of the bills on your desk and deal with the mess in the bedroom. Clearing the physical space around you will help clear your mental space, too. You'll be footloose and fancy free soon enough.",6,leo,2018
1,"Issues may get a little heavier than you'd perhaps like today, Leo. Your job is to infuse some amusement into the situation. Your powers of adaptability will be put to the test, as other people seem to be completely fixated on their opinions. Be extra conscious of how your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, are apt to be offended by careless, offhand remarks.",7,leo,2018
2,"Yesterday's trajectory might run into a couple of snags today, Leo. You could find that your dreamy nature conflicts with the planned and steady. This conflict of interests may be creating some tension that will be difficult to work with. Your emotions are apt to deceive you, so try not to get pulled off course by a passing whim. Try to keep your feelings well grounded.",7,leo,2018
3,"You might feel like you've come out of the dark and into the light today, Leo. A weight has been lifted, but there's still a great deal of emotional drama that needs to work itself out. Go for a long walk this afternoon and increase your lung capacity. Get your heart rate up. You'll find that the more active you are, the better you'll be able to sort through your emotional trauma.",7,leo,2018
4,"Today will be like playing a game on your home field, Leo. You have fans out there supporting you and you know the territory. Take advantage of the little things that you have going for you. There is a dramatic force at work that may be erratic but extremely powerful as long as you can maintain control. Stay focused on your goals. True happiness is only a small step away!",7,leo,2018
5,"Give your loved ones the attention they need today, Leo. Don't let another day go by without saying you love them. Life is short and getting shorter with each passing day. Feel free to be confrontational about a serious issue that needs to be addressed. You're responsible for your own feelings. Don't play the role of the victim. You'll only experience more pain and resentment later.",7,leo,2018
6,"When faced with ten entrees on the menu, it might be hard for you to choose just one. Feel free to order two or more, Leo. Don't let indecisiveness slow you down. At the same time, don't view it as something negative. The key for today is to go with the flow. Expand your dreams as far and wide as you wish. Have fun as long as you're willing to take full responsibility for your actions.",7,leo,2018
7,"You may find your brain buzzing around like a bee today, Leo. This is good. There's a great deal of information that you need to process now. Have you been thinking about buying some new electronic equipment or small appliances for your home? Now is a great time to do some research on this project before you pull out your wallet. Use this day to gather facts.",7,leo,2018
8,"You should be able to evaluate your emotions from a very neutral, detached perspective today, Leo. Use this opportunity to take action based on what you feel. Make sure your actions aren't reactionary and that you aren't simply acting rashly in response to someone else's hasty maneuvers. Think before you make any sudden moves. You'll be amazed at what incredible things can develop if you simply use your head a bit first.",7,leo,2018
9,"It could be hard for you to feel connected to anyone today, Leo. You're probably better off keeping to yourself. If you're feeling sad or depressed, it's best to work through these feelings on your own. Other people aren't apt to be too sympathetic to your situation. You're better off sticking to your work in order to keep the demons out of your head.",7,leo,2018
10,"It's a terrific day for you, Leo, one in which you'll find that your jovial approach to every situation is just what the doctor ordered. Spend time with children and enjoy their magical world. Spread your love and affection to the people around you. Make sure that the corners of people's mouths are turning up instead of down. A friendly attitude will take you far.",7,leo,2018
11,"Group events taking place at churches, meditation centers, and other places with a spiritual orientation could draw you near, Leo. You might want to attend a service or program at one of them. Don't be surprised if some profound insights come to you that shed some light on a current situation you might be dealing with. Write them down or you might forget them later.",7,leo,2018
12,"A good tactic for you today would be to convert your fears into motivation for positive action. There's a great deal of energy at your disposal, Leo, so don't waste it. Be aware that this is one of those times in which the smallest comment or insult could set off a huge chain reaction of misinformation or battles. People are quite emotionally charged, so be careful where you step.",7,leo,2018
13,"Suddenly you've found your energy again. Your engine is oiled up and ready to go, Leo. Put yourself in high gear and don't let anything stand in your way. If disagreements with others arise, try to keep focused on the lessons that come from the situation instead of dwelling on the negative aspects. Take things to a higher level and don't be afraid to suggest radical change.",7,leo,2018
14,"Recent developments have brought new interests into your life, Leo. As a result, you might be seriously considering enrolling in a formal course of study involving these subjects. If you really want to do this, it's definitely the right time to start. Others in your community might want to do the same, so a get-together to discuss the subject might help. Books and magazines could also be useful.",7,leo,2018
15,"A female friend you haven't seen for a while could surprise you with a call or visit. A lot of interesting news and useful information could be exchanged that benefits both of you. You may make a number of short journeys throughout the day, Leo, as you have a lot that needs doing. A small increase in income could also be in the works. In the evening, rent a romantic video.",7,leo,2018
16,"An appealing new face could appear on the scene today, Leo. This might lead to a new friendship, although this person could be charming enough to bring out your insecurities. Put these aside - you're looking great. Since your efficiency is at an all-time high, plan on taking advantage of that by dealing with some errands you've been postponing for quite some time.",7,leo,2018
17,"Because your tendency recently has been to brood over everything, Leo, a day like this can't be anything but beneficial. It has been difficult for you to find material satisfaction of late, but today offers you a view into the world of the intangible and unreal. You may find it especially gratifying to participate in an artistic or religious activity.",7,leo,2018
18,"Some enlightening conversations could occur today with a partner, Leo, possibly romantic, possibly career-related. New methods of operation could come to your attention, perhaps involving modern technology that could speed up the process and increase your income. Bear in mind that some of what you hear may not be feasible for a while. Other ideas may never be practicable. Remember to remain objective and check out the facts.",7,leo,2018
19,"Your sensual side is likely to show itself today, Leo. You might find yourself viewing young folks in tight jeans more appreciatively than you usually do. Racy novels and movies might also suddenly seem appealing. Romantic encounters are intense and passionate, so make sure you allow plenty of time for them. Enjoy yourself!",7,leo,2018
20,"In general, your spirit is upbeat, freedom loving, and adventurous, Leo. Today, however, you might find that it's a bit more intense and possibly somber, especially when it comes to romantic issues. This approach to matters of the heart isn't exactly your normal style, but you're apt to find that it's appropriate for your situation now. Make sure you have the right tools for the job at hand.",7,leo,2018
21,"Today your powers of persuasion are at an all-time high. This is a good day to ask for a raise or promote a new project. Your drive to gain recognition for your accomplishments may necessitate seeking the public eye, so if publicity is what you need, this is the day to go for it. Your observational skills are acute, as is your insight into others' feelings. This is definitely a good day to seek advancement.",7,leo,2018
22,"It may feel as if something or someone is trying to keep you from moving ahead with your ambitious goals and aggressive nature, Leo. At first you may resent this ball and chain attached to your ankle, but on closer examination, you'll see that this hindrance is actually a help. For now it's serving as an important reminder to slow down and do more thinking and planning before taking action.",7,leo,2018
23,"You may have endless ideas streaming through your head but little patience to see any of them through to the end, Leo. Perhaps you're so busy jumping from one thought to the next that you don't take any of them far enough to know whether or not they're worth pursuing. Write thoughts down as they come to you, and go over them later when your mind is in a quieter state.",7,leo,2018
24,"Don't get thrown off your path, Leo. Focus inward and concentrate on the tasks at hand. This may not be the most lighthearted and jovial day, but one must always take the good with the bad. Use the sober, grounding tone of today's energy to get down to business and stay there. Work now, play later! Remember the story about the ant and the grasshopper. Now is the time to store provisions for the future.",7,leo,2018
25,"You may experience a transformation in your thinking. It's bound to affect every aspect of your life, Leo. By always questioning, you work through difficult issues that require a constant reshuffling of viewpoints. Feel free to open yourself up to new ways of thinking as you dismiss old ways that no longer serve you. Now is a terrific time to consider a fresh wave of thought. You'll be exposed to a new way of truth.",7,leo,2018
26,"An unexpected opportunity to take a short trip could present itself today, Leo. Hop on that boat or train and see where it goes. If you have no real reason to travel, make one up. You don't need one anyway. The point is that it's time to get away from your current surroundings and explore other ways of living. If the time isn't right for you to get out and travel, at least make a plan now for a trip later.",7,leo,2018
27,"Today is a very powerful day for you, Leo. You may find yourself going to extremes in certain areas of your life, especially when it comes to your romantic nature. You could be pulled way over to one side and then to the other. At first you may give it your all and the next minute completely withdraw. Try to find a balance in this seesaw game.",7,leo,2018
28,"Get things out in the open today, Leo. If someone seems to insult you, call them on it. Letting things fester inside only destroys your self-esteem. You'd also be in danger of losing the respect of others. This could very well be a situation in which everyone but you sees the truth. Try not to let this happen. Be bold and assertive, and don't let others pull the wool over your eyes.",7,leo,2018
29,"It's OK to be wrong, Leo. If you know you've made a mistake, feel free to admit it. Don't let your ego stand in the way of progress. Others won't want to deal with you if you insist that what you're doing is right all the time when perhaps it isn't. Your mind may be a bit more fragile on a day like this, so try to be more sensitive and receptive than usual.",7,leo,2018
30,"Today is your day to become a hero, Leo. You don't have to be dressed in fancy tights and a cape to make an important difference in someone's life. Step up to the plate even if it isn't your turn at bat. True heroes are the ones who are able to do what needs to be done when necessary, regardless of the circumstances.",7,leo,2018
31,"Much has happened recently, Leo. Have you allowed enough time to process it? It's likely that big changes are brewing at home or work. Stay focused on the job at hand rather than fret about events over which you have no control. You may feel as if you're on a roller-coaster ride, but everything will settle down in a few days. Blink to adjust your eyes to the strange new light.",7,leo,2018
1,"Today's planetary configurations are pushing you to get some perspective on your life and the lives of people closest to you, Leo. You must admit that you've been rather selfish lately. You aren't the center of the universe, so why do you sometimes act like you are? This is a day to make amends with friends and loved ones. They'll welcome you back with open arms.",8,leo,2018
2,"Don't worry about not being on the right path, Leo, because you are. You seem to always be in the right place at the right time.

Even though you may not be able to change a certain situation, you can at least change your reaction to it.",8,leo,2018
3,"Slow down and take a more reserved, sensitive, and calculated approach to things today, Leo, especially when it comes to matters involving love and beauty. You'll find a greater level of sensuality waiting for you when you're willing to open up the door even wider. Go after the object of your desire, but make sure that your approach is sensitive and disciplined.",8,leo,2018
4,"There may be a bit of opposition coming at you, Leo. There's a light, airy feeling that's prevalent everywhere. This is definitely the kind of energy you can connect with today. There's a great deal of strength in numbers. Don't let anyone try to stand in your way. It could very well be that they are operating on incorrect information.",8,leo,2018
5,"Expected calls or deliveries may prove more trouble than they're worth, Leo. You could get involved in endless games of phone tag, and deliveries might come when you're out. This can be avoided if you're prepared. Make sure everyone knows what you're expecting so they can watch for it. Tell people the best times to phone and be available at those times. Don't worry. You'll manage.",8,leo,2018
6,"Be passionate about the thing you love the most, Leo. Instead of trying to eat every single thing at the buffet table, just pick one or two items that you like the best and eat them with great enjoyment. Feel free to take some for later. Don't let anyone talk you into a dish that doesn't appeal to you. You're the only one who knows what you truly hunger for.",8,leo,2018
7,"This is one of those days in which you're better able to stand back and look at your emotions intellectually, Leo. Your freedom-loving nature isn't built to deal with heavy emotional baggage and turmoil, so don't bother trying. Be especially wary of those who seem to plop a problem in front of you and expect you to deal with it.",8,leo,2018
8,"Leo, who's that intriguing new person in your neighborhood? What is it about this new neighbor that makes it impossible for you to stop wondering about them? Quit obsessing. Get your courage up and go over and introduce yourself. Welcome him or her to the neighborhood. Maybe you'll find this person likable, maybe not, but give it a shot anyway. Enjoy.",8,leo,2018
9,"Emotions run high as disagreements turn into quarrels among members of a group you're affiliated with, Leo. Stay out of it. It won't do you any good to get involved. Write your impressions and share them after tempers have cooled. You might want to make one final push toward reaching a personal goal, but forces beyond your control could block you. Try to remain patient.",8,leo,2018
10,"Someone who interests you could seem to be showing interest in someone else. This might arouse your insecurities and cause a bit of jealousy. Don't make yourself crazy, Leo. All may not be as it seems. Try to discern the facts. Invitations to more than one social event on the same night might force you to make an uncomfortable choice. Make the one that suits you best.",8,leo,2018
11,"An intense, emotional dream could move you so powerfully that you awaken with the odd sense that the dream was real. Write it down, Leo. Maybe it is. Efforts to overcome obstacles and advance in business could finally pay off. You could walk around in a daze asking yourself if it really has happened. It has. Make the most of it, and don't be afraid to show your feelings.",8,leo,2018
12,"Group activities or social events in your neighborhood could put you in touch with new and exciting people who eventually become friends, Leo. Shared goals and interests could give rise to plans for ambitious projects. Whatever enterprises you start today are likely to prove successful if everyone involved pitches in. This evening, enjoy quiet time with your partner.",8,leo,2018
13,"A love partner may have heard some great career news today and want to take you out to celebrate, Leo. Go - no matter what you have to reschedule.

Also make sure you look your very best.",8,leo,2018
14,"Today you might wake up feeling that you can move mountains - and this might be exactly what you set out to do, figuratively speaking. Your physical energy, enthusiasm, and self-confidence are very high, Leo. Your own and others' creative projects could take up a lot of your time. If you're coaching or helping others, however, avoid the temptation to take over the project.",8,leo,2018
15,"You have lots of energy and self-confidence, Leo. That's wonderful, but it may also put you at greater risk for dangerous experiences and accidents. You could find that you're much more aggressive, especially if someone crosses you. An emotional irritation could manifest in physical ways like reckless driving or arguments with people who don't deserve your anger.",8,leo,2018
16,"Make some plans for recreation, Leo. Having something fun to look forward to can make even the toughest times far easier to handle. You'll be amazed at how much you can manage when there's an end in sight. Your whole attitude lightens, so take the bull by the horns and create your own incentives. Do something special to reward yourself for the hard work you do every day.",8,leo,2018
17,"It won't be surprising if you're frustrated with a close friend or partner who's far less ambitious than you, Leo. The energy in the air can emphasize your dynamic ways of reaching goals and achieving success. Others who are passive or fearful may be difficult for you to understand. Yet people have to do things in ways that are best for them. Try to be patient.",8,leo,2018
18,"Welcome to another great day, Leo! The energy from the planetary aspects is positive and encouraging, especially when it comes to communicating and interacting with others. Take advantage of this. Get together with friends and family for a pleasant visit. Consider inviting people over for games or dinner. A potluck can be fun. You work hard all the time, so play gently today.",8,leo,2018
19,"Leo, consider that artistic expression can happen in many ways. It isn't always about drawing a picture, singing a song, playing music, or acting. The way you arrange your home or workspace is an artistic expression, as are how you dress and do your hair. Each thing you do is an expression of your style. You are uniquely artistic. Enjoy this gift today.",8,leo,2018
20,"Follow your instincts, Leo. Even if you have a tendency to listen more to your reason, put that aside. While your ears can hear words, your intuition can hear what's between the lines and provide you with a much bigger picture. If something sounds right but feels wrong, you'll be better off trusting your feelings. Act with careful consideration and caution.",8,leo,2018
21,"Leo, if there's something interesting that you've wanted to try, this is a great day for it. Adventure brings excitement, creative flow, and energy, which are essential to you.

You'll get the adrenaline you need.",8,leo,2018
22,"The fire within you is raging today, Leo, and you should be careful how you wield this power. Be proud and triumphant. Walk with your shoulders back and head high. Freedom is important, but make sure that others don't interpret it as you not caring about a person or situation that's actually quite meaningful to you. Let your heart speak openly and honestly.",8,leo,2018
23,"Today is your day, Leo, so live it up! If it seems like things have been rather intense lately, don't worry, they're apt to lighten up quite a bit today.

Bring things up to your level and you'll find that others willingly join you there.",8,leo,2018
24,"Some new information about an interesting field could have you browsing the web and looking through books to learn more, Leo. This could involve law, philosophy, history, or spirituality.

25,"Conversations with a friend whose good sense you trust could open your eyes to new career possibilities, Leo. You might think about transforming your working life.

You'll probably be glad you did.",8,leo,2018
26,"Make sure that the battle you fight today is yours, Leo. There's a great deal of tension in the air that might erupt when you least expect it.

Your philosophical viewpoint and strong spirit are the very combination needed to resolve the situation.",8,leo,2018
27,"A great deal of wind fills your sails today, Leo, so set your course for a long-distance trip to an exotic place. Things are coming to a dramatic climax right now.

Think about taking a different path.",8,leo,2018
28,"You're likely aware of your writing abilities, Leo, but you may not realize the extent of your talent. It would be worthwhile to devote more time to your craft. You can't improve much if writing time is interrupted by other obligations. Take some time to produce something of value. Why not give it a try, even if just for a week or so, to see what you can do?",8,leo,2018
29,"You tend to be curious, Leo, and you're always trying to learn more about your many interests. But today you could be eager to research a subject but be unable to find any information about it no matter how many libraries or databases you explore. Don't bother with it today. You'll only get frustrated. Watch some television. At least you'll get a few laughs.",8,leo,2018
30,"Happiness reigns in the home, Leo, as everyone seems to have reached a new understanding of one another. You could also experience a new sense of peace and quiet. Everyone is concentrating more on reading and working on their own projects and less on socializing. This could be a wonderful time for you. You're getting along with your family and the house is a peaceful haven. Enjoy!",8,leo,2018
31,"You may be feeling a bit more in touch with your warrior side than your emotional side today, Leo. More than likely this will set the stage for conflict in your world of hopes and dreams. Be careful that you aren't too aggressive toward people who are just trying to help you. The danger here is that you're most likely to hurt the ones closest to you. Be careful.",8,leo,2018
1,"If work is beginning to feel more like a burden than a joy, it may be time to rethink your job, Leo. Your personality is such that you need lots of room to stretch and grow.

2,"Your emotions could feel restricted today, Leo, a feeling that may be difficult to shake. Take this opportunity to calm down and relax.

Group activities may also be appealing now, particularly those regarding humanitarian pursuits.",9,leo,2018
5,"Your mood should be good today, Leo, although you should be careful not to rub it in others' faces. If people don't feel like being cheerful, don't force it on them.

This is a good time to train your psychic abilities or try reading runes or tarot cards.",9,leo,2018
7,"Interesting communications from friends could center on possible world developments or maybe some juicy gossip about people you know, Leo. Enjoy yourself, but don't take everything you hear at face value. Much of it is less actual fact than the product of someone's fertile imagination. Short journeys in your area could bring news of upcoming changes in your community. Expect the unexpected!",9,leo,2018
8,Your mind may be going a thousand miles an hour today. You might be inundated with new ideas and information that could cause mental overload. Write it all down if you can. You'll want to refer to it later. It might be advisable to then go out for a walk or other exercise. This intellectual overload could produce excess nervous energy that you'll need to work off.,9,leo,2018
9,"Matters regarding love and romance are in your favor today, Leo. You'll find that love comes to you when you least expect it. There's a powerful creative force within you that will be most rewarding if you put it to use for some sort of artistic endeavor. A strong yet erratic urge may call you into action, so be ready to respond with your entire being.",9,leo,2018
10,"Don't be surprised if lots of visitors show up today. Perhaps you're hosting an impromptu social event or neighbors bring news of changes nearby. You should be brimming with energy, so you can handle it, but you might find it a bit unnerving if it gets too exciting. It's best just to go with the flow and enjoy situations like this.

The force behind your emotions is tremendous.",12,virgo,2017
8,"Expect to enjoy today. You're in great shape and operating at peak performance. These are excellent conditions for working or creating. Given the chance, your mind will teem with innovative ideas. Put effort into everything you do today. If the opportunity comes up to participate in a new venture, give it serious thought. It could be a smart move.",12,virgo,2017
9,"Don't get too hooked on the free spirit that may dominate the morning hours. Have your fun at that time, but all good things must come to an end at some point. You may be called on for a more serious job when evening rolls around. Instead of plowing ahead and working to get things done the way you want, be more sensitive to others and more grounded in your approach.",12,virgo,2017
10,"An intense phone call, perhaps some kind of cry for help, could come today from a relative or close friend. You're more strongly equipped than usual to help someone in need, but try to stay objective. The person may be exaggerating the situation or confused about its true nature. In fact, all communications could be confusing. It may be difficult to separate fears from reality.",12,virgo,2017
11,"You're in the process of learning how to dream again. These last few months have been hard because your possibilities have felt limited. You've done a lot of work recently to try to align your fantasy life with reality. The result of this effort is that your desire to realize your dreams has increased! Go after them, but gently.",12,virgo,2017
12,"It wouldn't be surprising if you enrolled in a class that's very different from your normal activities. For example, a surfer may get a sudden urge to learn about computers, or a technology guru might take up flower arranging. Those who think they have you all figured out will be taken off guard by your new spontaneity and sense of adventure.",12,virgo,2017
13,"It seems like the basis of your social ambition has taken a bit of a beating lately. The planetary energies should give you some new desires. They may be of a more modest nature, but that doesn't mean they won't be important. What motivates you professionally is going to be healthier and less egotistical. It will ultimately be a positive, satisfying evolution.",12,virgo,2017
14,"Good news about money could fill you with ideas about how to spend it, particularly on your home. Maybe you need new furniture or have been thinking about painting or redecorating. This is a great time to do it as long as you're careful and not to let your exuberance get the better of you. You don't want to have to repaint or take unwanted furniture back to the store.",12,virgo,2017
15,"A class you've wanted to take may open up, and you'll want to register right away. You might have a few difficulties. If you try to sign up by phone, the line may be busy. If you enroll online, the website might crash. Don't get discouraged and give up. These are only temporary delays. You won't want to miss the class. Keep trying!",12,virgo,2017
16,"Your efficient, practical abilities are operating at a very high level today. A long-term goal you've been working toward could finally be reached, bringing good fortune and acknowledgment. Your efforts will probably be appreciated. Major advancement could be in the works.",12,virgo,2017
17,"Go out and play today. Escape your work mode and have fun. Drive someplace new and take a long walk outside with friends. You have a lot of energy, so share your enthusiasm with others. There's an exciting buzz in the air that you should tap into and contribute to. Take a break from the mundane and have an adventure.",12,virgo,2017
18,There's increased emotional tension today. You may be at the forefront of the action as you take things higher and farther. Have a map handy or you could wind up alone in the middle of nowhere. Other people will be looking for something practical in your approach so they have something solid to lean on during this time.,12,virgo,2017
19,"You may experience an emotional climax today. Things could come to a head. Don't be surprised if you run into some serious opposition. Disperse your energy freely, but don't be surprised if other people try to pull you in the opposite direction. Flexibility is a key aspect for you. Free yourself from restraints and improvise.",12,virgo,2017
20,"There's aggressiveness to your emotions today. This feeling will command your attention and demand that you be stable and reasonable regarding all tasks you undertake. Be honest and understanding. No one will understand obscure metaphors unless they have some practical use. Water your plants and clean up your yard. The closer you can be to the Earth today, the better.",12,virgo,2017
21,"Imagine yourself as part of a magnificent choir today. Your role is to sing beautifully but be aware of the other voices, too. Make sure your song isn't drowning out anyone else. Stay integrated into the events of today. Don't try to be overbearing, but make sure that your voice is heard.",12,virgo,2017
22,"You need a guide. This is a time to learn from the master of a domain, even if it means putting yourself in the role of disciple. This is a wonderful change for you, especially because you're often the one teaching others. This kind of exercise can do you a world of good. If there's a new subject you want to study, now is the time to embrace it.",12,virgo,2017
23,"Though communication is one of your strong points, today you might find it hard. You may feel introspective, but open, honest discussion could be what you need now. Your long-held ideas and values are changing, and you might require guidance to put your new beliefs to work. A search for truth is in your future, and you'll want some companions along the way.",12,virgo,2017
24,"This will be a day of reflection. While you may be tempted to look back and think about how far you've come, your time would be better spent thinking about what the future has in store. You've entered a period of rethinking both your identity and objectives. These aren't small matters. You'll need every ounce of energy at your disposal to make it through this time of transition.",12,virgo,2017
25,Restrictive forces may come into conflict with you today. The good news is that you should be able to find a space of peace within your emotions. Seek a mediator who can help you sort out stalemates that may exist between you and others. Opportunities for freedom and autonomy are out there waiting for you to grab. Seek the bizarre and unconventional ways of doing things.,12,virgo,2017
26,"The mood is somewhat oppressive today. If you could, you'd send away anyone who tries to put obstacles in your path. Or maybe you'd prefer to go away yourself! The day ahead is good for a realistic test of the waters. How far do you think you can go with your individual potential, emotionally and professionally?",12,virgo,2017
27,"This isn't the moment to adhere to a particular philosophy, whatever it may be. You may feel frustrated by your inability to figure out which path to take, but this is very good for you. Continue to search with your little flashlight, as weak as it may seem, because this is how you're going to get solid faith back again. Best of all, it will be a faith tailored for you.",12,virgo,2017
28,"Be polite and try your best not to impose on other people today. It's important to behave civilly in all circumstances. People may feel like they've been cheated. Although you may not be the source of their discontent, you may feel the consequences. Keep other people's issues separate from yours, and don't let their discomfort seep into your world.",12,virgo,2017
29,"You're always intellectually curious, but today you might be especially so. Although you're usually idealistic, today your imagination is in full swing. You might want to try writing or painting. It will be better to go with fiction or impressionism than history or realism. Study of spiritual or esoteric subjects is likely to clear a path between intellect and intuition.",12,virgo,2017
30,"Don't try to nail down any answers today, Virgo, because you'll probably just end up feeling more frustrated than when you started. The less you try to force your will on others, the more you'll find that things just automatically go your way. Today isn't about finding solutions to problems; it's about enjoying that which you have already learned and accomplished. Keep things light.",12,virgo,2017
31,"You could be feeling especially sensual and passionate today, Virgo, and you'll want to get together with a love interest. However, other responsibilities could get in your way. This could provide you with the perfect excuse to sink into gloom, but don't fall into this trap. Get whatever business you're facing handled and out of the way. Or perhaps you can arrange to finish it tomorrow. Then set up that hot date!",12,virgo,2017
1,"Today, Virgo, you might begin work on a project that you've wanted to do for a long time. This may be career related or personal, but either way it should advance you in whatever direction that you want to go. The only downside is that you might be a bit too hard on yourself and far too critical of your work. Try to be objective and view your own work as fairly as you would view the work of others.",1,virgo,2018
2,"You could be feeling the push-pull of internal desires versus external demands today, Virgo. As much as you want to stay in bed today, with covers pulled tight to your chin, the world is clamoring for your attention. Your phone rings off the hook and your email box fills as quickly as you can empty it. Just for today, you wish everyone would go away. Alas, no such luck. Promise yourself that you'll indulge some relaxation once you get home. Hopefully, no one will come pounding on the door!",1,virgo,2018
3,"Today you may discover that you have more in common with your neighbors than you thought, Virgo. It's likely that some sort of local event has brought all your neighbors together under one roof. You go as an obligation, but stay out of interest and a genuine willingness to participate. There is nothing like rolling up one's sleeves and working together to tackle a common goal. Expect to make some good friends in the process.",1,virgo,2018
4,"Put that book down and get out of the house, Virgo! You've been by yourself long enough; it's time to start interacting with other people. In addition to having heaps of fun, you're likely to have some encounters that will prove beneficial in the long run. Group situations are great, but don't overlook the pleasures of an intimate one-on-one encounter.",1,virgo,2018
5,"The need to complete an important task could have you mustering a far higher level of self-control than you're used to, Virgo. Perseverance and determination could dominate your mood, and therefore you could accomplish wonders. However, be sure to take breaks occasionally, and remember to relax from time to time. Above all, don't be so focused on your work that you forget to eat. Your work will only suffer if you neglect your body. Pace yourself!",1,virgo,2018
6,"An unexpected lucky break could come your way today, Virgo - something you would never have expected in a hundred years. It could seem like a dream come true, yet it could disrupt your life in some way. You might find yourself facing a choice: go for it and change your entire way of life or let it go and take the risk that another great opportunity might never appear. Who said life was easy? Think about it!",1,virgo,2018
7,"It's another fortuitous day for finances, Virgo, so be sure to take advantage of any opportunities that come your way. Though, in your usual analytical style, you will be careful first to do a thorough review of the plusses and minuses of the proposal. Much as you benefit from being at your desk today, don't forget to get outside to clear your mind. Be especially aware of any thoughts or ideas that come to you seemingly from out of the blue.",1,virgo,2018
8,"This is not the day to make financial investments of any kind, Virgo, although someone may present you with some possible opportunities. They may sound good, but caution is called for. If the information appeals to you, look into it and try to learn the facts, but make no commitment today. If it's truly a good opportunity, it won't disappear within a few days. If it isn't, you'll want to know. Wait!",1,virgo,2018
9,"We all know the adage, ""If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."" But you can't help feeling that you have tried and tried and tried to no avail. All that is about to change, Virgo, as you begin to reap the fruits of your labors. You can expect to see things from a new, unusual perspective. This will allow you to sidestep the obstacles that have been blocking you recently. Pay extra attention today and make a mental note, if not a physical one, of any unusual ideas you have.",1,virgo,2018
10,"A close friend or love partner might be feeling a little blue, Virgo, and could therefore ring you up wanting a sympathetic shoulder to cry on. You'll be of great help to this person this way, but don't let your friend distract you from other things you need to do. You may have errands to run, people to see, tasks to take care of. Give your friend as much time as you feel is appropriate, then make your excuses.",1,virgo,2018
11,"Have you just bought some new equipment for your home, Virgo? This could be a new computer, a state-of-the-art entertainment system, or perhaps a new appliance. You and the other members of your household might spend much of the day trying to learn how to use it, although it could seem rather difficult. Take heart! It looks more complicated than it is. Keep trying, and don't forget to have fun!",1,virgo,2018
12,"The prospect of future business opportunities could have you spending a lot of time on the phone today in discussion with friends or acquaintances who might have information you need, Virgo. Perhaps someone you know has been very successful at an activity he thinks might interest you. All should go very well, but you'll definitely want to be thoroughly informed. You're doing the right thing by securing the facts before plunging on ahead.",1,virgo,2018
13,"Worries about money that plague you today could well be misplaced, Virgo. To all appearances, the financial road might temporarily get a little rough, but probably all is not as dire as it seems. Let go of your panic for a moment and sit down and actually go over your figures. You'll probably find that some careful budgeting and a little belt tightening are all that are needed to get you through. You can do it.",1,virgo,2018
14,"Contacts made through friends or colleagues, perhaps younger people, might bring new ideas for bettering your home life, Virgo. Perhaps a new housemate wants to move in, you could install some new equipment, or you might even have the chance to move to a roomier place. These are only ideas to be considered, however. Final decisions should wait for a later day. There are still some facts that you need to learn first.",1,virgo,2018
15,"New information regarding opportunities for career, business, and personal expansion might shake up your value system today, Virgo. This is a positive development, although it may be a bit disconcerting for you right now. Your life could well take a different turn, starting today. An immediate desire for pleasure could be satisfied by scheduling a romantic dinner with a lover. Forget the changes that are happening for a while and enjoy your evening!",1,virgo,2018
16,"Successes over the past several weeks, along with an increase in money, might give rise to the desire to improve your living situation, Virgo. You might have doubts, however, as to how best to go about doing it. Should you move or should you simply remodel? Should you move close by or to a different area? It's best to simply list the pros and cons of each option and then consider them all carefully. You don't have to decide right now.",1,virgo,2018
17,"You generally tend toward a very high level of perseverance, Virgo. No matter how difficult a task may seem to you, today it should go very smoothly, particularly if it involves in-depth study or research of some kind. Your thinking is especially clear and down to Earth today, and your common sense is operating at a very high level. Get to whatever needs to be done today and there won't be any loose ends left for tomorrow.",1,virgo,2018
18,"Recent career advances may have you wondering where to go next. You could be considering taking some time off to travel or perhaps advance your education. You aren't likely to want to rest on your laurels, Virgo. Striving to reach new horizons is important to you, and today is the perfect day to consider what horizons are the most critical to you now. Nonetheless, it's important to be sure. Don't feel the need to rush into anything just yet.",1,virgo,2018
19,"You probably enjoy exploring the innermost recesses of your own human nature, Virgo. Yet today you may need to be a bit more rational. In your personal life, you may feel as if you've been beaten at your own game and this has weakened you. Why not take advantage of this to bring your partner with you on one of your voyages inside yourself?",1,virgo,2018
20,"You seem to have a lot of resentment toward someone who may have hurt you. Don't keep these feelings inside or they'll eat away at you, Virgo. Take advantage of your day today to put all your cards on the table and forget about revenge, because it could just turn against you. Instead, why don't you try to reach out to that person and explain your feelings to him or her? The good energy you get from this experience could be very beneficial to you tomorrow.",1,virgo,2018
21,"A long-awaited vacation may be coming up soon for you, Virgo. The study of travel books might be on your agenda for today. You could spend much of your day making the necessary arrangements, making phone calls, completing paperwork, and running errands. You might need to set up the care of pets or plants for your absence. Excitement runs high and so does enthusiasm. You have a lot to look forward to, so go out and celebrate! Have fun!",1,virgo,2018
22,"A class, lecture, or workshop could prove fascinating and stimulating for you today, Virgo. Plans for travel to a distant state or foreign country, perhaps in the company of friends or family members, could be confirmed, which should make you feel really good! Your relationships seem warm, supportive, and stable, even those with people who live far away from you. Have fun!",1,virgo,2018
23,"Today communication with others is more likely to be on a subtle rather than verbal level, Virgo. When the phone rings, you might already know who's on the other end of the line before you pick it up. You could also pick up telepathically on the thoughts of others. Books and articles about people who have had similar experiences could increase your understanding of them. Don't fight it! Go with the flow.",1,virgo,2018
24,"Realize that you may be controlling other people's actions without even consciously knowing it, Virgo. This is one of those days in which emotional outbursts could explode in your face as a result of other people's reactions to your pressure. Don't feel like you need to take on the responsibility of everyone else's actions. You may be having a hard enough time dealing with your own personal issues.",1,virgo,2018
25,"You might have visitors, Virgo, or even a hot date scheduled for tonight, but by mid-afternoon you might be feeling too tired to go through with it and wondering if you should cancel. It's best to keep your activities low key. Have coffee and snacks at home instead of going out, and get the snacks from the store! Your evening is likely to be full of exciting and stimulating conversations, so you'll be glad you stuck with your plans.",1,virgo,2018
26,"A number of visitors might come to your house today, Virgo, perhaps to discuss matters of interest to all of you. Some intense disagreements could arise, but you'll be able to keep it all together. An intellect enhanced by intuition enables you to understand and explain complex ideas, and you'll also be able to derail misunderstandings before they even happen. Providing tasty treats could also help smooth ruffled feathers.",1,virgo,2018
27,"Don't be surprised if you're scolded by people who are upset about the way you're handling certain things in your life, Virgo. Most likely, the people who criticize you the most are the ones who understand you the least. They are probably on a completely different wavelength than you, and it isn't your job to try to change them, nor is it your responsibility to change your ways because of them.",1,virgo,2018
28,"Too many unfinished tasks or chores today might have you feeling pressured to get them done, creating unnecessary stress and strain. Pace yourself and don't panic if you have to let some of them go for today. You're probably feeling more sensitive than usual, Virgo, so you might also pick up some moods from the people around you. Take periodic breaks and go out for a walk. This should clear your head and make things easier for you.",1,virgo,2018
29,"You're most likely going to be very drawn to the things that you can't have, Virgo. Instead of getting upset and frustrated by the fact that you aren't getting what you want, look for the lesson in the situation and the reason why you really don't need those things at all. Things with extremely high sentimental value may seem very important to you right now, but maybe there is an important reason why you need to let go and move on from that particular sentiment.",1,virgo,2018
30,"Financially, things seem to be going great for you right now, Virgo, and therefore you could plan to make an investment in your home. If you already own one, you might decide to remodel or redecorate. If not, then you could just haunt realtors' offices for the next few weeks. This is a good time to turn your energy toward improving your own space. Go for it and have fun!",1,virgo,2018
31,"Have you been looking to branch out in a new direction, Virgo? If so, this could be the day you get the lead of a lifetime. Or you might receive some unexpected information indicating possible new sources of income that you could pursue on your own. Whatever they are, new doors of opportunity are going to open for you that could make a big difference in your lifestyle and catapult you into a higher socioeconomic bracket. Make the most of it!",1,virgo,2018
1,"You may be anxious to fit things in your life into pigeonholes, Virgo. When it comes to matters of love and romance, this may be hard to do, especially on a day like today. Call upon your pioneering spirit to seek something new and not limit yourself to what you originally had in mind. Perhaps there is something bigger and better waiting for you. You’ll only find it if you dare to accept something outside the norm.",2,virgo,2018
2,"Try not to get blown off course by the fire that seems to be raging around you, Virgo. Ultimately, you know what’s right and what’s wrong, so don't compromise yourself or your sense of pride. Keep an eye open to what is going on in your circle, but don't feel like you need to chime in with a certain course of action that doesn't ring true with your inner self. Control what you can, but don't worry about the other situations.",2,virgo,2018
3,"Have you been toying with the idea of redecorating your house, Virgo? If so, you might actually come up with a few solid ideas, although you'll have a difficult time deciding among them. Sometimes making a list can help you work out the details of each and discern which is the most workable at this time. Look at home decorating magazines and furniture catalogs. Write down what appeals to you. You'll decide something. What fun!",2,virgo,2018
4,"Don't judge someone if he or she has a different lifestyle than what you consider to be OK, Virgo. You probably lean toward the traditional, yet not everyone feels this way about relationships, working, or lifestyle. While it may seem impossible to understand and even frighten you, try not to be too harsh on those you deem odd. You'd be better off using that energy to keep your own life on track.",2,virgo,2018
5,"See about using your good relationships with friends and loved ones today to get some group activities going, Virgo. Chances are you'll feel pretty good and the idea of socializing will appeal to you. See about inviting people over for supper or a game of cards. If you're especially lively, some sports may be just the ticket to get you out and moving. Do whatever it takes to have some fun and get some fresh air today.",2,virgo,2018
6,"You might find yourself really interested in getting out and doing something today, Virgo. And why not? It can’t be too difficult to phone a few friends and arrange to get together in the evening. Or perhaps you can look in the events page in your local newspaper and see whether a meeting or lecture is taking place that you'd like to attend. Is there a place you've been curious about and wanted to visit? If so, go there today and check it out. Make the best of your time!",2,virgo,2018
7,"Make some plans to write a letter, send a greeting card, or put together a package for someone far away today, Virgo. This can be a lot of fun to do, especially if the person on the receiving end isn't expecting anything from you. Pictures, crafts, cookies, candies, or books can make a wonderful package to send to someone special. Even a simple greeting card can really brighten someone's day. Have some fun.",2,virgo,2018
8,"Is there a person in your life who keeps coming to mind again and again, Virgo? If so, it might be time to get together. Whether there's something that needs to be worked out or you simply miss him or her, take the steps needed to connect, even if it takes email, letters, or a phone call to get in touch. Rather than having them pop into your head continuously, reach out and make contact.",2,virgo,2018
9,"Taking the easy way out won't tempt you in the least today, Virgo. This isn’t to say that you usually favor this approach, by any means; yet it's safe to say that everyone is tempted from time to time. Not so for you, though, as the planetary aspects are giving you the strength to take all of the necessary steps, however long they may be. Stand your ground if a partner tries to convince you otherwise.",2,virgo,2018
10,"A number of new people could come your way, Virgo, perhaps through projects of some kind with which you're involved. Some of them may appear to be trustworthy and some may not. Today, however, your instincts are highly attuned and you'll be better than usual at sizing up people you don't really know. Make the most of this ability, and don't let logic get in its way. Follow your heart!",2,virgo,2018
11,"Successes have been coming your way continually for a while, Virgo. The downside is that excessive celebrating and overindulging in food and drink could have you feeling physically out of sorts today. Nonetheless, your mood should still be very high, and you should still be strongly motivated to continue whatever it is you've been doing that has brought such positive results. Let your imagination flow freely, and keep on going.",2,virgo,2018
12,"Legal documents that concern your business may need to be executed today, Virgo. There might be a lot of paper to wade through, not to mention jargon that appears indecipherable. Don't get too impatient, however, as this is important. Instead, find someone more familiar with this sort of thing and get him or her to explain it all to you. Then, assuming it's agreeable, take care of it and move on. The results should be well worth it!",2,virgo,2018
13,"Careful planning on your part is starting to pay off, Virgo, but be careful that you don't alienate others in your quest to be the best. You may not realize how your harsh words affect the people around you. Be more sensitive to the feelings of others. Focus and be brave in your actions. Hesitation may cause you to lose control of the situation. Know your boundaries, but push beyond them.",2,virgo,2018
14,"Machines involved in financial transactions, such as ATMs, phone systems, or banking websites could malfunction today, Virgo, so you might have to resort to dealing with money in the old fashioned way: by going into the bank or writing checks. Electrical storms or solar flares could be interfering with satellite signals, so there isn’t much you can do. Needless to say, this isn’t a good day to make any major financial transactions.",2,virgo,2018
15,"Some rather boring and mundane tasks, perhaps involving paperwork, could take up much of your time today, Virgo. You could get easily distracted and be tempted to set it aside and do something more interesting, but don't fall into this trap. You'll want your recent pattern of success to continue, and so it's best to get the boring stuff out of the way and then move on to what's exciting. Hang in there!",2,virgo,2018
16,"You could well be bubbling over with physical energy today, Virgo. You might want to spend your day visiting with friends. You could pick up some interesting information from them, which you might be able to put to work for you. You could lay plans for finally attaining a long-term goal; perhaps a lucky break made this possible. Expect to spend most of your day talking and planning!",2,virgo,2018
17,"The desire to go off by yourself and enjoy a little solitude is likely to be in conflict with the reality of your obligations today, Virgo. You could find yourself spacing out at times and unable to concentrate on any tasks at hand, so try to stay focused. Some irritating letters or phone calls could come your way, but nothing that you can't deal with. See an exciting movie tonight.",2,virgo,2018
18,"You’re usually a very practical and down-to-Earth person, but today you may be more inclined than usual toward mysticism. Spiritual matters seem extremely appealing, and you could find yourself gravitating toward metaphysical bookstores or seeking discussions with people who are well versed in such matters. You also find your imagination working overtime. Indulge in a few flights of fancy, Virgo. We all need to escape from time to time!",2,virgo,2018
19,"A social event could put you in touch with someone who's carrying around a lot of bitterness and anger, Virgo. This probably won't be very pleasant for you, as this person could well see you as the perfect listening post for all their problems. Don't feel trapped! Be polite but make your excuses as soon as you can. There are other friends present whose company you'll enjoy a lot more!",2,virgo,2018
20,"Emotional issues rooted in the past could leave you feeling inhibited today, Virgo. You might also be a bit more touchy than usual and see insult where none is intended. Curb the impulse to take offense. Try to confront and release the old issues or at least promise yourself you'll deal with them later. Then be very sweet to your entourage. You should be feeling more positive by day's end.",2,virgo,2018
21,"Although your partner may be feeling very sensual at this time, Virgo, you might not feel much like getting passionate. You've had a stressful few days and can barely move, so your response to sexual overtures is apt to be lukewarm at best. Your affection certainly hasn't diminished, but your partner could interpret your behavior that way. Whatever you decide to do, make sure your friend knows exactly how you feel and why you feel that way.",2,virgo,2018
22,"The significant other in your life needs your support not a lecture right now, Virgo. Let him or her know you’re available to listen and help in any way, but don’t smother your partner with kindness. He or she will come to you when ready. In the meantime, Virgo, take care of your physical needs. If your body craves exercise, why not increase your jogging miles or add extra time to your gym workout? Absence does make the heart grow fonder, after all.",2,virgo,2018
23,"You’ve always had a knack for all things financial, Virgo, but today your ability is especially enhanced. You’ve discovered all the free investing information available over the Internet, and you absorb it like a sponge. Your natural fiscal sense enables you to separate the nonsense from the sound investment advice. Your portfolio and your mood benefit immediately!",2,virgo,2018
24,"You’re usually a hard worker, Virgo, whether the work involves a job, personal project, or simply chores around the house. Today, however, you're going through a fit of laziness. Chances are you don't want to do a thing except lie around and read or watch TV. It's OK. We all need time to let our hair down and relax. Don't suffer undue guilt because you don't feel like working.",2,virgo,2018
25,"You surprise yourself by signing up for a group lesson rather than a private one. This is unlike you; nevertheless, you find you enjoy the social interaction. Besides, whether you're learning cooking or rock climbing, it's always much more fun to learn with others. That way, you can learn from their mistakes and they from yours. It's bound to be a fun, adventurous day, Virgo. Enjoy it.",2,virgo,2018
26,"Let's hope you aren’t afraid of heights, Virgo, because today could have you climbing several rungs on the corporate ladder. It seems your hard work over these last few months has paid off. Don't hesitate to accept the challenge that’s offered to you. If you’re worried about skeletons buried in your office filing cabinets, you’d do well to come clean with the information. Likely your bosses will respect you for your candor and courage.",2,virgo,2018
27,"If a family member is in a bad mood but not confessing why, it's up to you to step in and help. He or she is carrying that big black cloud around, casting shadows everywhere they go. Do what you can to snap your relative out of it, although take care not to force the issue too harshly. Counseling might be in order, and this may not be your area of expertise!",2,virgo,2018
28,"Information that you retrieve from deep within your psyche might lead to a revelation as to a great way to increase your income, Virgo. This could be something you read and forgot, or it might be something you overheard in a restaurant. Whatever it is, look into it carefully, and then if the information seems to be accurate and useful, go for it. These days, fortunes are being made in surprising ways!",2,virgo,2018
1,"You have energy to burn, Virgo, and you intend to use it. Ask friends to join you in the park. Or set up a round-robin tennis match for the afternoon. Enjoy your day outdoors, but take care not to push too hard. If you strain muscles today, it could be weeks before you're fully healed. If you pace yourself and take plenty of water breaks, then you'll enjoy the day with no repercussions.",3,virgo,2018
2,"Profligate spending in the past may come back to haunt you now with regard to money, Virgo. There could be blocks in receiving funds you were expecting or an unexpected but necessary expense could come up. It's going to take all your talent for careful planning to work your way around this situation, but take heart. The situation can turn to a positive one in the blink of an eye, and probably will.",3,virgo,2018
3,"You may be feeling especially concerned with others today, Virgo. Your thoughts are with the less fortunate. Perhaps you should consider teaming up with a local church or other community organization to help your immediate community. Your spiritual well-being is also important to you today, and you should do something to honor this part of you. It could be hard for you to keep yourself grounded.",3,virgo,2018
4,"Personal or professional projects you've been working on might be moving a bit more slowly than you're comfortable with today, Virgo. You may wonder if this is because you aren't doing something right. This probably isn't the case. It's no doubt just a normal lag in the energy, which should pick up again tomorrow. Keep at it, get done what you have to, and don't make yourself crazy over it. Go with the flow.",3,virgo,2018
5,"Opportunities to increase your income by working out of your home could well present themselves today. There might be more than one, and you could be tempted to take them all on. Think about this carefully before you commit, Virgo. You're feeling energetic today, but that could flag on future days. Consider the situation honestly and objectively before making any firm decisions. You don't want to regret it later.",3,virgo,2018
6,"Reward yourself for all the great things you've done for you and other people, Virgo. You deserve to be treated like royalty, so make sure that you do. There are many times when you get so critical of the things you do that you end up punishing yourself unnecessarily. Give yourself a treat for being good instead of chastising yourself for being bad. At all times, however, you must remember that you're perfect just the way you are.",3,virgo,2018
7,"The key for you is to minimize your daily drama as much as possible, Virgo. You may not realize how much you cripple yourself by the way you exaggerate every aspect of your life. Try not to give so much of your attention to things that really don't matter much. Petty jealousy and gossip about other people's lives are especially irrelevant in your world.",3,virgo,2018
8,"You're apt to go in circles if you only see the negative side of every situation, Virgo. Your lack of perspective could keep you from seeing an answer right in front of you. Your mind is your greatest asset and your worst enemy. Don't become a victim of its automatic bias toward the negative. Once you take control and start looking at the positive aspects, the answer will become clear.",3,virgo,2018
9,"A phone call from your sweetheart might bring out your passionate, romantic side today, Virgo. You'll probably have a lot to do, and therefore not be able to meet with him or her until late. All signs indicate that the encounter will be worth the wait. You should be especially attuned to your partner right now. You might know instinctively what they need from you now. Buy some new clothes, and enjoy!",3,virgo,2018
10,"Take action on well-laid plans today, Virgo. Stay levelheaded, and seek pleasure by taking things steadily one step at a time. Watch out for a forceful, willful, fanciful mindset that will somehow cause conflict with your plans unless you consciously make an effort to keep the daydreaming to a minimum. The lines of reality may be blurred. Make sure you find the lines of distinction before you proceed.",3,virgo,2018
11,"The time for planning and calculating is over, Virgo. The time for taking aggressive action has arrived. If you don't have your armor ready, too bad. You'll be thrust onto the battlefield with the rest of the troops even if you're in your underwear. The more you try to delay the inevitable, the more difficult it will be. Bite the bullet and charge full-speed ahead with whatever protective gear you have.",3,virgo,2018
12,"Pure wisdom is an important quality for you to aspire to on this day, Virgo. Know that the wisdom you seek should come from a point of calm knowing and strength as opposed to a frantic, loud, and outlandish display for attention. You'll be recognized accordingly. Be aware that the more knowledge you spread to others, the more it will grow for everyone to profit by and share.",3,virgo,2018
13,"You may feel anxious today, even more so than usual, Virgo. Your nerves may be quite jittery, and there's a feeling that you may not be on exactly the right track. More than likely, what you need to do is simply calm down and relax. Let your brain slow down and think clearly without the distraction of many people telling you what to do.",3,virgo,2018
14,"Inspiration is the keyword for today, Virgo. An optimistic and enthusiastic attitude could lead to powerful imaginings, which may take solid form as plans for future projects. These could be artistic, business related, or centered around your home in some way. Whatever they are, this is a good day to put those plans into motion. All signs indicate success on any project begun or completed today.",3,virgo,2018
15,"Be careful of gossiping too much with your friends and colleagues, Virgo. It's fun to laugh and exchange stories, but remind yourself of the fact that the truth in a story is diminished and changed each time it's repeated. If you gossip too much, your friends may begin wondering what you say about them when they aren't there. Ultimately, this isn't healthy behavior for your friendships. Think about it.",3,virgo,2018
16,"Work could be a real drag today, Virgo. You might be expected to put in more hours than normal. Your heart isn't in it right now. You have interests of your own that you'd rather pursue, plus you could be planning to get together with friends or your partner later. It's best to finish everything quickly, perhaps postponing nonessential tasks, and then go and enjoy yourself.",3,virgo,2018
17,"You could be frustrated by others' lack of commitment today, Virgo. You could try to make plans with people but they keep changing their minds about what they want to do. Perhaps they're emotionally insecure and afraid to take the next step. Don't let other people hold you back. Make plans and stick to them. Other people will fall into place accordingly. You don't need to prod them.",3,virgo,2018
18,"Your physical energy is high and your ambition even higher, Virgo. You're likely to want to turn your mind to new projects that can advance your socioeconomic status. You could spend a lot of time today gathering information and sending it out, doing whatever it takes to accomplish your goals. A number of short journeys in your neighborhood are definitely on the agenda. Pace yourself so you don't get too tired.",3,virgo,2018
19,"You might be a bit confused with the mood of the day, Virgo, which fosters quick action and a sporadic approach to things. More than likely, this approach isn't exactly in line with your usual methodical protocol. Do what you can to merge with this energy in order to add a more spontaneous spark to your daily routine. Take a walk on the wild side today.",3,virgo,2018
20,"Today you might feel especially protective toward all those you love: children, family, friends, pets, and the special person in your life, Virgo. Upsetting news might have you wondering about the future, but don't let it get you down. All should be well, so allow yourself to relax and enjoy your loved ones. Distract yourself by going to an exciting movie. That will help release tension and put you in a better frame of mind.",3,virgo,2018
21,"A rush of humanitarian spirit and a desire to do some real good might find you looking into various charities in order to find those you might want to help. However, money could be flowing out for other purposes a bit too quickly for your tastes, Virgo. It perhaps would be best to find one group that suits you and give only to that one. Save other worthy causes for another time.",3,virgo,2018
22,"A lot of warm and loving communications could come your way today, Virgo. It could be in the form of letters, phone calls, emails, or texts Friends from far away whom you haven't heard from in a long time could keep you busy catching up on the phone. Relations with family members or a partner are likely to be supportive and intimate today. With this, your appreciation of those in your life may be highlighted.",3,virgo,2018
23,"Today you might want to put your innate business sense into making a success of a pet project of your own. This is a good idea, Virgo, because all signs indicate that whatever you begin today, whether it's for your employer or yourself, could well lead to success. You could, however, find yourself spending a little more money than you would normally care to. Don't hold yourself back, but be careful!",3,virgo,2018
24,"Occult sciences, such as alchemy, phrenology, and astrology, could be singing their siren song to you, Virgo. You like to think of yourself as down to Earth and realistic, but today you could find so-called unrealistic fields of knowledge irresistible. You'll also have a special gift for them right now. Read up on the subject and give it a try. You might be surprised at what you discover.",3,virgo,2018
25,"A long-anticipated visit from a close friend or love partner may have to be postponed, Virgo. This could be rather disheartening. You may fear that the postponement implies that the visit will never happen, but this isn't the case. Your friend has probably run into a few snags that need to be straightened out. Be patient and hang in there. All should work out as you want, albeit a bit later!",3,virgo,2018
26,"Your intuition has been steadily increasing over the past few months, Virgo, and today it could operate at a particularly high level. More than one premonition may come to you, and you'll probably find yourself picking up more frequently on the thoughts and feelings of others. If you're into the arts, inspiration may come that you should definitely make use of. Don't worry about what's practical. Think of inspiration as an assignment from the Universe!",3,virgo,2018
27,"You must weigh your physical limitations with your desire to get everything done, Virgo. You run the risk of wearing yourself out and getting sick just as you finish your tasks. Enlist the help of others, if you can, for all those chores and errands that absolutely need to be done. You should definitely leave anything that can wait. Your health needs to come first!",3,virgo,2018
28,"Money earned through involvement in the arts, perhaps those combining creativity with computer technology, could come your way, Virgo. Financially, you should be doing fairly well, so you might channel what you receive right back into this business. This is an excellent time to do this, as all signs indicate that this sort of activity could be very profitable over the next few years. Go for the gold, and enjoy yourself.",3,virgo,2018
29,"Suddenly you seem more glamorous than usual, Virgo. You may exert a mysterious appeal that in the 1920s was called ""it."" Current and potential love partners may take a second look and be intrigued. Don't be surprised if you attract admiring glances from strangers! This could make a big difference in your love life. Lovers you encounter today should continue to see something in you for a long time. Make the most of ""it""!",3,virgo,2018
30,"A project that you're working on, perhaps job related, perhaps personal, is likely to require more creative skill than you usually need, Virgo. Writing, drawing, or computer graphics could be involved. You might have some doubts about your abilities, but you're more likely to be surprised by the results. You're apt to enjoy working this way, and you may hope to continue. Keep up the good work, and good luck!",3,virgo,2018
31,"Are you expecting a close friend or love partner to visit you at home, Virgo? Don't panic if your friend doesn't show up at the allotted time. It doesn't mean that no one is coming! There probably has been a traffic jam, last-minute phone call, long line at the supermarket, or some other mundane delay. Be patient and your friend will show up eventually. Hang in there!",3,virgo,2018
1,"Do you have the uncomfortable feeling that you've forgotten something but you have no idea what it is, Virgo? Are you haunted by the memory of a seemingly insignificant past event, but can't figure out why? It isn't a good idea to obsess over either. You'll remember whatever it is eventually. You'll soon realize the significance of the memory. Your subconscious is trying to tell you something. You can't rush it, so relax!",4,virgo,2018
2,"As you work slowly and steadily toward your goals, realize that there are apt to be unexpected obstacles along the way, Virgo. You can't possibly plan for everything, so don't get discouraged today when some crazy variable pops out of nowhere. Your mental process may be thrown for a loop, and you might find that you go into a frenzy. There's a valuable lesson to be learned here - patience.",4,virgo,2018
3,"Once you've made up your mind, Virgo, it's doubtful that anyone can change it. You're set in your ways and your plans are set in stone. Having this solid base to stand on will let others support you effectively. You're trustworthy and predictable. Others can depend on you and know where they stand in relation to you. Don't let self-doubt slip in. This is your time to stand tall and proud.",4,virgo,2018
4,"You might be frustrated with romance because it seems to be causing more tension than relaxation, Virgo. No one said love was easy, but it doesn't have to be miserable. The key is to not get too stressed out about the little things. Know and expect that some things aren't going to match your expectations. You simply have no control over some aspects of a relationship - the other person, for example.",4,virgo,2018
5,"Generally, you come up with the perfect, witty answer one day too late. Impulse and intuition take a back seat to your excellent self-control. The day ahead presents one opportunity to let go of the inhibition that sometimes stymies you. Yield to your instincts a little and see what happens. A little more socializing wouldn't hurt, either. You're certainly entitled to some fun now and then!",4,virgo,2018
6,"When you woke up this morning, you may have felt an oppressive mood hanging in the air. Unfortunately, that haze of misunderstanding and conflict is likely to last all day. However, it makes this an ideal time to speak up about anything that's bothering you! Don't be shy about going on the warpath today. If you don't, Virgo, you're likely to be the target of a surprise attack.",4,virgo,2018
7,"A rather upsetting dream could disturb your sleep tonight, Virgo. When you wake up and focus on the real world, it could seem so bizarre as to not be worthy of serious consideration. Nonetheless, write it down. After some time has passed, go over the symbols and see what they suggest to you. The dream is trying to tell you something about a specific situation in your life, albeit in a weird way!",4,virgo,2018
8,"A public figure, perhaps an author, might capture your interest in some way today, Virgo. This person could have a lot to say that appeals to you on a number of different levels. You'll want to acquaint yourself with as much of this person's work as possible. You could experience some valuable personal insights. Don't worry if your practical mind chides you for this obsession. Sometimes it's a good thing!",4,virgo,2018
9,"An opportunity to travel to a place you've always wanted to visit, perhaps for business reasons, could come your way today, Virgo. This could be very exciting, but you might have some difficulty making the arrangements. Flights could be full, hotels too costly, and responsibilities at home might need attention. But you can find a way to deal with any obstacle. Think creatively and get busy!",4,virgo,2018
10,"Plans to go away on vacation or perhaps a business trip could be put on hold today, Virgo. Events you might have been scheduled to attend could be temporarily postponed.

Be your usual ingenious self and you'll find something! Go to it!",4,virgo,2018
11,"Communication takes a prominent place in your life today, Virgo. Your practical, direct, and down-to-Earth manner can be very impressive. You're known for succeeding where others have failed. This isn't lost on those above you on the hierarchical ladder. And they know that you aren't easily fooled. Expect steady personal and professional progress and a great boost to your self-confidence!",4,virgo,2018
12,"Your values could undergo a complete turnaround today, Virgo. Recent developments in the world, your community, among your circle of friends, and within you could make you realize, like it or not, you and everyone around you is going through a transformation. This might be a little disconcerting, but it's a positive development. Take things one day at a time and see where they go. You'll probably like it!",4,virgo,2018
13,"You're too hard on yourself, Virgo. If things haven't gone exactly as planned over the last few days, there's no sense in berating yourself over it. As long as you did the best that you could, what's the problem? It's likely you've experienced a delay and not a cancellation. All signs indicate that your goals will come to fruition even though it might take longer than you'd anticipated.",4,virgo,2018
14,"You're looking good and your social skills are at their peak, Virgo. Therefore, social events and group activities that you might attend today could well be the most satisfying and beneficial you've known in a long time. People you meet should be impressed with you, and you could make a lot of new friends. If you aren't romantically involved now, a new love could come your way.",4,virgo,2018
15,"You're likely to receive news today that brightens your future outlook, Virgo. It could be that your boss calls you at home and hints at a pending promotion, or your partner could receive a raise or unusually large bonus.

A vacation may just be in order.",4,virgo,2018
16,"You might be feeling a little tense because you and your partner are grappling with some thorny financial issues right now, Virgo. You could be frustrated because you need to postpone some purchases or investments until the cash starts flowing more freely again. The good news is that this is a fine time to work out such a conflict to a satisfactory resolution. Both of you will need to be open-minded and look at all sides as you make your decisions.",4,virgo,2018
17,"You work hard to reach your goal of financial independence, Virgo. All signs indicate that you're well on your way. Today you could receive some news that makes you realize you aren't there yet. Perhaps a relative calls to say you're no longer his/her sole beneficiary. Maybe your investment statement shows a poor return. This isn't what you expected, but you're still on the right track. It just might take a bit longer to reach your destination.",4,virgo,2018
18,"Keep your eyes and ears open to all new possibilities, Virgo. Even if it isn't your habit to read the ""Help Wanted"" section of the newspaper, do so today. You might be surprised at what you find there. Your skills apply to all sorts of jobs. You don't need to limit your search to one profession. You have a good mind that's working in overdrive now. Use it to figure out the next steps for your advancement.",4,virgo,2018
19,"Today should be a ""no holds barred"" day as you strategize your next career move, Virgo. If you were in the army, you'd be a five-star general by now - your tactical sense is that good. Unfortunately, your office isn't handing out stars. You'll have to be satisfied with a raise and promotion - the least they can offer after all your hard work. If no such offer is forthcoming, go and ask for it!",4,virgo,2018
20,"If you're feeling needy today, you might consider seeking counsel from others, Virgo. Close partners might make light of the situation, so if you're looking for deep metaphysical advice, you might want to look elsewhere. Most of all, pamper yourself with some relaxing downtime. This day is well suited for playing board games, watching a movie, or reading the latest edition of your favorite magazine.",4,virgo,2018
21,"A future course of action that you may or may not take could depend on information you might receive today, Virgo. However, don't be surprised if the information is vague and needs to be clarified. On top of it all, you might not be able to reach the person who can clear it up for you! Hang in there. You'll want to make up your mind as soon as possible.",4,virgo,2018
22,"If you've been uncertain about the possibility of a raise in your salary, Virgo, today you could finally be told for certain that it's coming. This is definitely cause for celebration. You might want to call a friend or romantic partner and propose a night on the town. Your good luck shows signs of continuing if you keep on working as hard as you have been. Now it's time to enjoy it!",4,virgo,2018
23,"A love partner could contact you out of the blue, Virgo, perhaps proposing that the two of you get together tonight - alone. You're in just the mood for this, since you're feeling especially sexy and not particularly afraid to show it. An evening at home or in a dark corner of your favorite restaurant might be just the ticket. Don't be surprised if your friend orders champagne and shows up with flowers! Have fun!",4,virgo,2018
24,"There is a lot of tension in the air today, Virgo. It isn't just affecting your home environment - everyone you meet seems out of sorts. You'll be happiest if you spend much of today in solitude. Books don't honk their horn at you and DVDs don't curse your driving ability. Who needs the aggravation that a day like today can bring? Enjoy a day away from other people's bad moods.",4,virgo,2018
25,"You always suspected that your job was making you crazy, but it never occurred to you that it could make you sick, too. Is it really worth it, Virgo? You may be asking yourself this question today. Fortunately, your talents apply to several professions. Why not take a closer look at other fields? One way or another, it's clear that change is coming. You might as well be the one who directs it.",4,virgo,2018
26,"Today is another passionate day in a series of passionate days! Usually, Virgo, you're a fairly reserved person where feelings are concerned. You'll be much more demonstrative with your emotions over the next few days. You can be like a fire trapped inside a wall of ice, and today that ice is beginning to melt! Let it – and enjoy it!",4,virgo,2018
27,"Don't hesitate to try something new today, Virgo. If you've thought about joining a book club or taking a class, do it today! You're likely to meet some interesting people and enter a new social world. You might be tentative at first, but you'll find the group warm, friendly, and eager for your input. You'll talk like old friends by the end of the second meeting. This is just the infusion of fun you need!",4,virgo,2018
28,"Your financial goals could seem vague and uncertain at this time, Virgo. Perhaps you face a crossroads in your life as far as income goes, and you might not be sure which way to go. Or else you could be planning to make some purchases and have a hard time deciding which are most important. This probably isn't the day to try to make any kind of decision. Wait a day or two.",4,virgo,2018
29,"Have you been thinking about getting fit by investing in some exercise equipment? If so, Virgo, this might be the day to actually go out and get it. Don't be surprised if friends, relatives, and neighbors all want to come over and try it out. Health and fitness are very much on your mind right now, so you might also want to pick up some books on whatever discipline interests you the most.",4,virgo,2018
30,"A friend might be in such a dour mood that you wonder if this is the same person you know and love, Virgo. During the day you might be tempted to try to analyze what's going on, but this is apt to raise more questions than answers. Probably this is a case of too many problems hitting your friend at once. Don't pry, but make sure your friend knows you're there if needed.",4,virgo,2018
1,"You may have been wishing for some recognition and appreciation lately. Perhaps you had your eye on a promotion at work. The day ahead will show you which path will be the most productive. In order to succeed, Virgo, you have to plan everything carefully and focus on one goal. You should be sure you have support for that goal. There's a long, hard climb ahead, but you're bound to make it!",5,virgo,2018
2,"The day will be fairly quiet for you, Virgo. You're likely to yoke yourself to a task and continue working on it until evening. If someone tries to persuade you to take a break, it won't be all that difficult to resist. This is one day when you should follow your instincts, keep your head down, and focus on the task at hand.",5,virgo,2018
3,"The best way to create harmony among others is to first establish harmony in yourself, Virgo. Don't expect others to take care of you and attend to all your desires. At the same time, it isn't your responsibility to dote on others. The boundaries may get ambiguous at times, but do your best to maintain a healthy separation. People may pull on your heartstrings to manipulate you into doing what they want. Don't fall for it.",5,virgo,2018
4,"Today is the kind of day when all you want to do is think about a vacation. You're usually such a responsible, conscientious worker that you can afford to escape for just a few minutes. You could visit the world inside of you. You may even find something that's been on your mind for quite some time that requires some action by you now.",5,virgo,2018
5,"You might decide to spend a large part of the day working on a project that requires a lot of mental energy. Plans to spend some time with either a close friend or lover might not turn out to be quite what you'd hoped, Virgo. Your friend could be in a rather gloomy mood. A relaxing evening, perhaps a concert or funny movie, can release tension and boost bad moods. Enjoy!",5,virgo,2018
6,"Some short trips in your neighborhood and contact with neighbors or visitors to your community could bring some interesting information your way, Virgo. It gets you thinking about ways to improve your socioeconomic status and probably your professional standing. Spiritual and philosophical discussions could also take place. In addition, your insights can prove as valuable as any outside information. Trust your intuition and follow your heart.",5,virgo,2018
7,"Finding the comfort point may be difficult for you, Virgo. You might feel as if you aren't connecting with your ideals or goals. Even though you try to put things into motion, they don't really pan out the way you'd like. There's a difficult energy making you feel like you need to join one camp or the other to feel accepted. The problem is that neither side looks appealing. Feel free to start your own camp.",5,virgo,2018
8,"Love and romance should be going well for you now, Virgo. However, today you could find that things get a bit uneasy when either you or your partner suspects something isn't true or is suspicious about the situation at hand. Someone may get caught in a difficult predicament when the veil of deception is suddenly lifted and the truth revealed. There could be some difficult explaining to do.",5,virgo,2018
9,"You may have been feeling somewhat disillusioned. Perhaps you lost sight of your goals or misplaced your faith in yourself. You'll feel some relief beginning today. This is an opportunity to end what has been a somewhat apathetic and moody phase and begin a new one that's based on work and meditation. As you can imagine, this new phase will be much more fulfilling!",5,virgo,2018
10,"You're a great creator of systems, Virgo. You can tinker with every sort of construction, from theories and computer programs to scientific experiments and strategic evaluations. Today the planets are guiding you. You're a perfect computer, capable of synthesizing random events into pure reason. You're sure to attract attention if you share your thoughts with others.",5,virgo,2018
11,"Your ideas about life are going through some radical changes. None of the givens that you've always taken for granted apply any more, Virgo. Rather than lament the changes, grow from them. So don't drag your feet! Stand up and move ahead. This is no time for a vacation. You have some rebuilding to do.",5,virgo,2018
12,"You'll go one of two ways today, Virgo. Either you'll turn inward and meditate in a corner or you'll find a good friend and confide your dissatisfaction. Don't hesitate to let your guard down and express yourself even more honestly than is typical for you. Have no worries that your problems will bore your friend. True friends are happy to help. You'd do the same, wouldn't you?",5,virgo,2018
13,"Expect a lot of intellectual stimulation to come your way today, Virgo. Important news could come on the phone, necessitating action on your part in order to bring about a desired end. You might need to spend time in the car, contacting others in the neighborhood. The excitement of the moment could have you feeling especially optimistic, but take care to pace yourself. Exhaustion could prove counterproductive now.",5,virgo,2018
14,"Discard those items from the past for which you really no longer have use. As much as you like to surround yourself with objects of sentimental value, the time comes when it's necessary to look to the future rather than dwell on the past.

15,"An important aspect has passed, and you are in the process of reaping the benefit from it, Virgo. It was only a matter of becoming aware of and settling certain matters related to your need for social recognition. Don't be so hungry for approval, Virgo. Most people contain a stern inner authority figure and can survive comfortably and self-sufficiently. In fact, it's your greatest strength.",5,virgo,2018
16,"You may have felt an oppressive mood hanging in the air when you woke up this morning, Virgo. Unfortunately, that haze of misunderstanding and conflict is likely to last all day. However, it makes this an ideal time to speak up about anything that's bothering you! Don't be shy about going on the warpath today. If you don't, you're likely to be the target of a surprise attack.",5,virgo,2018
17,"Your current plan of attack may run into some snags today, Virgo. This might be caused by an emotional need that you may not have recognized earlier.

There's a great deal of compassion in the air.",5,virgo,2018
18,"Today time will stop and might even seem to go backward, Virgo. Use this pause to reflect on your motivations.

22,"Is there some material need weighing on your spirit right now, Virgo? If you can't see how to solve the problem alone, why not discuss it with your friends? They may have some ideas. Today, the word ""impossible"" has been banished from the English language. Take advantage of the opportunity to look for solutions in unlikely places.",5,virgo,2018
23,"Don't put up with anyone's shenanigans, Virgo. Your time is too precious and your energy too powerful to waste on those who see you as a fair-weather friend or emotional crutch. Concentrate on your own problems. If someone has a sob story, tell him or her exactly what you think. No need to pad the honest truth with a bunch of fluff just to make the other person feel good.",5,virgo,2018
24,"You, of all people, will appreciate the need for structure and stability on a day like this, Virgo. This practical energy could be taking some of the fun out of the equation.

Make sure you hold tight to the things that give your life passion and purpose.",5,virgo,2018
25,"If you're in love, Virgo, you'll love today. You could plan for almost anything from a little trip together to a lifetime full of children and grandchildren.

27,"Goals that may have seemed unreachable in the recent past are finally starting to come into focus, Virgo.

Be patient and you'll find that even your wildest fantasies will start to come to fruition.",5,virgo,2018
28,"Things may not be as obvious as they first seem today, Virgo. Don't get started on a project until you understand the full scope of what you're getting into.

5,"The economy could well take a small dip, Virgo, and you might hear from people expressing concerns about financial matters. Don't take them to heart, and certainly don't worry about your own financial condition. The trend will probably reverse itself soon, and this time in the right direction.

6,"Romance is center stage today as social events put you in touch with interesting people of both sexes, Virgo. If you're already involved, expect to grow closer to your partner. If you aren't, don't be surprised if someone new comes into your life. Stimulating discussions about various subjects set your imagination going and increase your desire to learn more. Enjoy your day.",6,virgo,2018
7,"A number of children could cross your path today, perhaps at a social event. You might get caught up in their games and momentarily experience being a child again yourself.

12,"Relationships of all kinds are likely to be strengthened by an increased level of understanding today, Virgo. Your thinking is greatly enhanced by your emotional intuitiveness, so you'll be more able than usual to identify with the needs and desires of those around you. As a result, acquaintances could become friends, and friendships could progress into bonds that last for life. Romance also benefits from intensified empathy. Enjoy.",6,virgo,2018
13,"If you need to execute legal papers of any kind, Virgo, you couldn't find a better day to do it. Relationships, particularly romantic ones, should be especially warm, supportive, and rewarding.

17,"A partnership of some kind, perhaps business, perhaps romantic, is likely to be on your mind today. You might want to seriously consider whether or not it has a future, and if it does, what to do next. You could spend time socializing, Virgo, but you could be too preoccupied to participate much. A lot of serious decisions need to be made. The outcome is likely to be positive. Try to relax and have some fun.",6,virgo,2018
18,"You're organized and rigorous, Virgo. You plan everything. But with today's energy, you'll be inclined to let the day go by without keeping to a tight schedule.

You'll even think about new ways to organize your life.",6,virgo,2018
19,"How about changing roles today, Virgo? It's true that you aren't one for idle chat. You prefer taking action rather than talking about grandiose ideas that never go anywhere.

Other people will be grateful, since they've been waiting a long time for this day.",6,virgo,2018
20,"You tend to think that you're the only person on this planet born under a lucky star, Virgo. Try to trust the ones you love, because they might not appreciate having to deal with your anxiety.

Tomorrow you should be your old self again.",6,virgo,2018
22,"You might be charged with energy but feel you have nowhere to aim it, Virgo. The force is there, but the goal may not be. Talking with others may only confuse you. Listen to yourself.

There's nothing wrong with stillness.",6,virgo,2018

You should definitely enjoy your successes while still making use of your common sense.",6,virgo,2018

Other people might seem less communicative than usual, Virgo, and you're likely to be preoccupied with your own thoughts.

30,"The world is wide open to you today, Virgo. Take advantage of all the great things on offer. You may not realize it, but you have a loyal fan club building in the wings.

Your grounded mind and solid perspective are incredible assets in any situation.",6,virgo,2018
1,"If the doorknob doesn't want to turn today, Virgo, don't force it. You'll only succeed in breaking the key. Perhaps you just need to try another door.

View the situation as a rest period.",7,virgo,2018

Don't become a leach or burden to others.",7,virgo,2018
5,"Don't run away from tension today, Virgo. Any sort of emotional stress you feel will be compounded tremendously if it isn't dealt with right away. Be in the moment while the moment is here.

Today is a great day to let your imagination call the shots.",7,virgo,2018
7,"Don't automatically assume that you can work out all your problems by yourself, Virgo.

Those you encounter won't be able to help smiling back.",7,virgo,2018
11,"It's likely that the previous few days have been especially hectic, Virgo. Today you're apt to entertain a few daydreams about getting away from it all.

You might feel too fanciful to be your usual practical self.",7,virgo,2018
12,"You're likely to face conflicting reports today, Virgo. Information may be tainted with emotion, so be careful about going with the choice that shouts the loudest.

Take care of any detective work that needs doing.",7,virgo,2018
13,"You may be a bit daunted by the frenzy of energy present in the air today, Virgo. Try not to get thrown off balance by others who may be more abrasive than usual.

Unexpected events are likely to come on the scene.",7,virgo,2018
14,"Your mind is especially sharp, Virgo. You're logical and objective by nature. However, today you're likely to find that your thinking is more influenced by feeling than usual. This is a positive development. It demonstrates that your intuition is operating at a high level, so don't fight it. This is definitely the day to follow your heart rather than your head.",7,virgo,2018
15,"With the current aspects at play, Virgo, you could find that the hard work you've done in the past finally brings financial rewards. This will make you very happy, but don't get carried away and go on a spending spree! Treat yourself a little. Celebrate with a friend. Take care to exercise a little good sense. You don't want to buy too much and have to take a lot of it back to the store.",7,virgo,2018
16,"A male friend could introduce you to people from foreign countries or people who have traveled a lot. They might have valuable information that you could use later. This information could also help you finish old projects that have been waiting to be done. Your eye for detail is especially acute, Virgo. Make notes of interesting facts even if they don't apply right now. You'll make good use of them later.",7,virgo,2018
17,"There are days when you feel wonderful without being able to attribute the feeling to any real event. Of course, your rational mind will search for a reason for the happiness.

20,"It's important for you not to overanalyze every little detail of your situation now, Virgo, especially when it comes to love and romance issues.

Release your stranglehold on certain issues and concentrate on simply rebuilding your own self-confidence.",7,virgo,2018
21,"This day bodes well for accomplishments in business and finance. Long-term investments of either time or funds may finally pay off. New opportunities could come your way.

Wear them for a longtime friend or lover this evening.",7,virgo,2018
22,"You're apt to feel more talkative than usual, Virgo. There are many times when you may shrink from a situation in disgust or perhaps boredom.

Others are more likely to listen to what you have to say, so be honest when someone comes to you with a question or situation that he or she needs help with.",7,virgo,2018
23,"It's OK to change your opinion, Virgo. You may pride yourself on being the solid one who always has an answer or knows exactly where to go.

Don't get so hung up on a certain way of doing things that you fail to see the wisdom in a new and different approach.",7,virgo,2018
26,"If you aren't paying close attention today, Virgo, you might miss what's said. Important information is being relayed quickly, so don't miss out on the action. It may not be important for you to agree with everything you hear, but at least listen to it and seriously consider incorporating elements into your point of view. Don't dismiss other opinions just because they're new and different from your own.",7,virgo,2018
27,"You may not understand what all the fuss is about today, Virgo. Suddenly there's a fire burning all around and you may be left questioning the motivations behind others' actions.

29,"Be careful about being too critical today, Virgo. You're likely to turn people away if you aren't careful with how you express yourself.

30,"There's a great deal of fun to be had today, Virgo. Money isn't always necessary to make this happen, however. In fact, money isn't a great way to keep score.

1,"This is a day to be up front with your partner, Virgo. It's possible that your relationship has reached some sort of stalemate. It's up to you to get that fire burning brightly once again. How? You know the drill - romantic time alone is all it takes. A nice outfit, a reservation at the best restaurant, and you and your mate are back in business.",8,virgo,2018
2,"A war could be brewing in your world today, Virgo. Emotionally charged arguments shoot back and forth with conviction. Try not to get discouraged. Don't burn any bridges either. Remember that your words may fall on extremely sensitive ears, so use them with care. There's a very active part of your psyche that needs to be heard. Feel free to say your peace openly and honestly.",8,virgo,2018
3,"You may be at a rather climactic point now in the department of love and beauty, Virgo. Your creative levels are peaking and you might feel a strong urge to create something on a giant canvas. Realize that discipline is needed to get those artistic juices flowing. Don't let fear stop you. Initiate your dreams and let the details fall into place later.",8,virgo,2018
4,"What seems like the perfect plan today may not necessarily seem like the perfect plan tomorrow, Virgo. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. There's an expansive feeling in the air that's working to catch you up in its net and pull you into its plan. Beware of get-rich-quick schemes. The wool could get pulled over your eyes on a day like this.",8,virgo,2018
5,"A temporary delay in receiving some expected funds might force you to postpone a much-needed purchase, Virgo. Don't make yourself crazy over this. It isn't worth the stress. The delay is disheartening, but it isn't a cancellation. Your money will arrive and you'll be able to go ahead with your plans. In the meantime, keep yourself busy. Hang in there.",8,virgo,2018
6,"You may feel like a skipping record, Virgo. You've been scratched and mistreated, and now you continue to repeat the same thing over and over until you've driven your point home. This isn't your doing, so don't be concerned if you hear protests that you're sending others over the edge. This may be the very thing necessary for all of you to advance to the next step.",8,virgo,2018
7,"Prepare for a surprise today, Virgo. Perhaps it will come from someone else or perhaps it will come from you. Either way, by evening you're apt to be feeling quite lovey-dovey and rather spaced out. Give in to the lethargic attitude that might sweep over you. This is your time to play, so put work aside and have a good time while letting your emotions dictate your actions.",8,virgo,2018
8,"An unexpected letter could arrive today, Virgo, with a check enclosed, perhaps a gift, bonus, or offer to make more money. This might be a welcome break, possibly coming at a time when you really need it. If it's work, don't worry about the time involved. You'll be able to finish it quickly and efficiently. It might lead to more offers in the future.",8,virgo,2018
9,"Pressure to get unfinished tasks completed and new ones begun causes emotions to run high, Virgo. Everyone, including you, is likely to feel tired and stressed, and quarrels may erupt. It might be best if you focus on the tasks at hand and ignore the petty squabbles that crop up around you. This will keep your blood pressure down and reassure those you want to impress.",8,virgo,2018
10,"Someone is keeping secrets from you. We all have private issues, Virgo, but this situation affects you. Your intuition will probably tell you who the person is. Try to get them to open up without exerting pressure. Unfinished tasks could drive you crazy. You may try to race through them, which can cause too much stress. Get the crucial ones done and let the others go. Relax with a movie tonight.",8,virgo,2018
11,"Emotional discussions with your partner could move you to tears, Virgo. You've overcome any difficulties and probably reached a new understanding.

It's OK at times like this.",8,virgo,2018
12,"Have you wanted to move in a new direction, Virgo? If so, this could be when you get the lead of a lifetime.

13,"Relations with family and other household members should be at their very best today, Virgo. If you see colleagues outside of work, they could also be congenial and supportive.

14,"Today you could recapture the joy in life that you had as a child, Virgo. You're serious by nature, and feelings of joy are to be lived and treasured. You could be experiencing true flow. There might not be any real reason for it, so don't try to find one. Your imagination and your relationships with others could be enhanced as a result. Relish the moment.",8,virgo,2018
15,"Be happy with yourself and others, Virgo. Stop trying to find fault with everyone you interact with. By criticizing what they do and how they do it, you could wake up one morning and find that you have no friends. By only seeing the bad in people, you may talk yourself out of relationships with them. Be careful about coming across as a know-it-all. It isn't your job to dictate or judge.",8,virgo,2018
16,"Don't judge someone just because his or her lifestyle differs from what you consider normal, Virgo. You may be traditional, but not everyone shares your view of relationships, work, or lifestyle. While this may seem hard to understand and even frightening to you, try not to be too hard on others. You'll be better off using that energy to keep your own life on track.",8,virgo,2018
17,"See about using your good relationships with friends and loved ones to get group activities going today, Virgo. You're probably feeling great, and the idea of socializing appeals to you.

20,"Feed your mind with new knowledge, Virgo. Visit a bookstore or read some interesting information online. If you have more time, visit the library or explore courses that you might like.

Do what you can to clean out as many mental and physical corners as possible.",8,virgo,2018
22,"There may be a great deal of fuss over something that seems quite insignificant to you, Virgo. Try to see the beauty and importance of everything around you.

Egos are apt to go through a bit of a transformation that will affect the way you react to the outside world.",8,virgo,2018
23,"Be careful that you aren't acting in a way that you dislike in others, Virgo. You could find that you're slowly taking on the traits of the people you despise.

24,"Today you might learn about new and creative ways to increase your income, Virgo, possibly involving technology in some way.

Your mind could be going so fast that you need to take a walk to clear your head.",8,virgo,2018
25,"Strange dreams, insights, or visions could upend your spiritual orientation, Virgo. These new ideas could have your mind going a thousand miles an hour and shake up concepts that you've embraced for most of your life. Think about it without making yourself crazy. What you're receiving is nothing more Earthshaking than information to consider and then accept or reject.",8,virgo,2018
26,"Wake up on the right side of bed, Virgo. This will set the tone for the rest of the day. Keep things positive and you'll find that the aggressive energies of the day work for instead of against you.

Don't get caught up in unnecessary drama that has nothing to do with your situation.",8,virgo,2018
28,"Tact isn't necessarily your strong suit, Virgo. No one would accuse you of being overly sensitive to other people's emotions, but today you turn over a new leaf.

29,"The need to attend to business or networking obligations disguised as parties could get to you today, Virgo.

It's a warm, fuzzy feeling that could stay with you all evening.",8,virgo,2018
31,"You may find that someone or something is thinking or working opposite to the way you are, Virgo. This feeling is aggravated even more by a strong warrior force that wants to be recognized.

1,"You're especially in tune with the environment and the people around you today, Virgo.

Even though this is outside your usual experience, try to accept rather than analyze.",9,virgo,2018
2,"It could be hard to find your footing early in the day, Virgo. You may be better off sleeping in. Have a good breakfast and relax in the morning.

You'd be better off turning this energy inward now.",9,virgo,2018
3,"The special someone in your life may be having some trouble with colleagues. Don't just comfort him or her, Virgo. It's unlikely that your sweetie wants sympathy. Solutions are needed. If you don't have any, just be a good listener. It's important for you to get out and exercise. If the weather is good, take a walk. If not, attend an exercise class. You'll feel better.",9,virgo,2018
4,Finances could take on a new dimension as you look to technology to help you increase your bank balance. You could decide to invest online or try some new means of recordkeeping. Whatever you try will bode well for your financial future. Expect a lucky break or two as well.,9,virgo,2018
5,"It isn't a good idea to talk behind other people's backs today, Virgo. If you have an issue with someone in particular, bring it up to that person directly. This isn't a good time to gossip. Maintaining trust is extremely important right now. This attitude will open many doors for you. Believe that the more you love others, the more love will be returned to you.",9,virgo,2018
6,"If you happen to be thinking about a particular friend today, Virgo, don't be surprised if you hear from him or her. You're especially attuned to telepathic messages, and you may send out a few.

And why not, if this allows you to get the perspective you need on things? Use this period in your life to give things their real value and to see where certain people actually fit into your world. You're a very lucky person to be able to find this kind of balance in your life.",1,libra,2018
21,"This could prove to be a very busy day, Libra. Someone close to you might come to you for advice on how to manage their resources, perhaps because of successes you've had in the past. This might take up more time than you'd planned for, but you'll enjoy helping your friend. Information received from TV or newspapers could bring a new interest into your life and spur you on to do some research on the subject.",1,libra,2018
22,"If you've been thinking of buying a home or otherwise purchasing real estate, Libra, this is the day to start the ball rolling or finalize the deal, depending on your situation. Investments in property planned at this time should continue to increase steadily in value. However, make sure this is the right investment for you before committing to anything. Otherwise, you might be stuck with something you don't like for a long time.",1,libra,2018
23,"Inspiration drawn from recent religious or spiritual occurrences could have you writing down accounts of your experiences, Libra, perhaps with the idea of someday publishing them. Your concentration could well be intense, as writing for you today may not be only creative but therapeutic as well. It will also help to attend classes or workshops or simply to discuss the subject with a friend. Knowledge is essential.",1,libra,2018
24,"Beware of unexpected circumstances today, Libra. The good news is that your flexible attitude is perfectly suited to deal with the twists and turns that this day is likely to offer. While other people may get upset when their plans go awry, you'll find that you can surf the waves easily and turn any situation into a positive one, regardless of the way in which you planned things to work out originally.",1,libra,2018
25,"Deliveries you may be expecting could be delayed or held up. Today you might learn something shocking about a neighbor or relative, and gossip might spread very rapidly through your community. This could have you reeling even though it might be exaggerated. You could pay visits to a few people nearby, Libra, or spend a lot of time on the phone trying to learn the truth. Don't take anything you hear today at face value.",1,libra,2018
26,"If you're into computers and the Internet, Libra, you can expect to spend a lot of time today staring at a screen. You may be doing some writing or web design or animation, but whatever it is, you'll probably find it noticeably better than what you usually produce. Intellect joins with intuition to produce inspiration and insight. Make the most of it now and you might develop some new and lasting skills!",1,libra,2018
27,"You may find yourself flying high for no particular reason, Libra. If you aren't, stop and examine the situation. More than likely, any emotional discomfort you feel is due to a lack of personal freedom in one way or another. Perhaps you're feeling too tied down emotionally or too restrained mentally. Perhaps you need to get out of your current situation entirely. Use this day to seek ways to feel more independence in your world.",1,libra,2018
28,"Emotional levels run high among members of a group you're affiliated with as disagreements turn into quarrels. Stay out of this, Libra, it won't do you any good. Write down your impressions and share them with the others at another time when tempers have cooled down. You might find yourself wanting to make one final push toward attaining a personal goal of your own, but you could be blocked by forces beyond your control. Try to remain patient!",1,libra,2018
29,"You may find yourself staring at a blank page for what seems like hours on end while you try to get down on paper what you really want to say, Libra. Perhaps your motivation is flagging. Your mind is soaring in the clouds today and it may be hard for it to keep on task. However, once you start the act of writing or whatever job you need to finish, things seem to flow to completion on their own.",1,libra,2018
30,"At this time, Libra, most of your focus is on either a group you're affiliated with or an intellectual subject in which you have an intense interest, or perhaps both! The arts, particularly writing and drawing, might be among these subjects. A number of your closest friends could share your interest, particularly a woman who lives nearby, so you can expect some exciting discussions over the next few days. Enjoy!",1,libra,2018
31,"Unusual circumstances could arise that change the course of your creative orientation, Libra. This could involve modern technology in some way, and it’s highly likely that it concerns the gathering, sharing, and use of information. You could find yourself considering some unusual options, which could involve changing jobs, your residence, or other factors important to your lifestyle. Think carefully before plunging in. Tonight, spend some quality time with the special someone in your life.",1,libra,2018
1,"You may feel like going back to being a student in junior high, Libra, just going through puberty and joining the other kids in animated discussions about who likes whom and who’s going out with whom. Follow your whim with phone calls to close friends who’d be happy to share in your childlike nature. Wear something red today in order to serve as a reminder of the radiance of your loving heart.",2,libra,2018
2,"Pick yourself up by your bootstraps and go in for the kill today, Libra. You’re in a terrific position to make some strong and lasting impressions on others. Any sort of group work is especially favored. There’s a powerful boost behind your actions, so be careful where you aim your weapons. Initiate action in the places where issues seem to be stagnating. Transformation is a key aspect to healthy growth. Today is an excellent day to pursue such important goals.",2,libra,2018
3,"Emotions run high today as a love partner calls on you to discuss some troubles, Libra. These don't directly concern you, but you’d still like to see them straightened out, as you tend to feel helpless when someone you care for is upset. At times like this, it's really best to listen rather than try to give advice. Your partner probably just needs to talk it out. Be patient and all will be well.",2,libra,2018
4,"Friends seeking advice or a shoulder to cry on could be plentiful today, Libra. You're one of best people to give them the support and care they need. Just be sure that you don't give so much to others that you don't have anything left for yourself. True friendship is about sharing and the exchange of problems and help. Running yourself down will leave you in a place where you aren’t going to be much help to anyone.",2,libra,2018
5,"If you're lacking a regular exercise routine, Libra, today's a great day to turn that around. Exercise doesn't have to wear you out or hurt. Even relaxing activities like walking or yoga are excellent ways to keep you in good shape. Participating in a sport that appeals to you like volleyball or bowling combines fun with exercise. Heck, even dancing is a recognized form of exercise! See about finding something that will work for you.",2,libra,2018
6,"Consider channeling your philosophical inspirations into some creative writing, Libra. You’ll certainly enjoy this type of activity. Even if you haven't explored this before, there's no better day than today to give it a whirl. Why not start a journal if you haven't done so already? This will give your ideas a place to incubate, and it can become a starting point for further reflection. Or you could try your hand at poetry and fiction instead.",2,libra,2018
7,"It's a good day for you to put some of those creative ideas to work, Libra. Pull out your favorite craft supplies and have some fun exploring color and design. If you have children, consider including them in the activities. It may amaze you to listen to the incredible ideas and innovative thoughts your own kids have that you’ve never thought of. If you don't have an ""idea box"" where old bottles, nuts and bolts, odd buttons, ribbons, and scraps of material can collect for times like this, start one today!",2,libra,2018
8,"Your usual outgoing and often radical nature may be far more conservative today, Libra. This can be a result of the day's planetary influences, and if used well, this mood can prove most beneficial. It can add seriousness to your day that suits such activities as goal setting, budget planning, or recovery. Make the most of this energy by digging into the areas of your life that could use some rethinking.",2,libra,2018
9,"Practicality and planning will work well for you today, Libra. It's a good time to take a long look at your financial situation. Are you where you want to be? Have you got plans in place for down the road? Do you have sufficient cash flow? Think about what you'd like to improve and make some plans. You can include talking with a financial planner or trusted banker to create more options for yourself.",2,libra,2018
10,"The opportunity to attend one or more huge social gatherings, such as balls or banquets, might come your way today, Libra. You might want to attend in the company of a small group of friends. This could be business related or involve a group with which you're affiliated. Nonetheless, it shows the promise of developing into an enlightening experience in one way or another. Accept the invitation and start making your plans!",2,libra,2018
11,"Upheavals within a group with which you're affiliated, perhaps professionally, might cause you to alter your goals slightly, Libra. In the long run, this could well prove to be a positive development, although the conditions leading to it could be a bit disconcerting. Think of this as an opportunity to pursue new hopes and dreams that you may not have considered before. Plan carefully and then go for the gold.",2,libra,2018
12,"Today you might consider making an investment of time, energy, and perhaps a little money in a creative project of some kind, Libra. This could also involve modern technology in some way. You could have several colleagues who want to work with you on this, and therefore the entire enterprise could be very exciting. Be sure not to lose sight of the practical details involved or you might never get it off the ground.",2,libra,2018
13,"A little foreign culture could be the thing you need right now to spice things up a bit, Libra. It could be that you aren't feeling a very strong connection with the environment around you. You could be anxious to spread your wings and explore your freedom. Start small but think big. Get out of your rut and do more exploring on your own. There’s a sobering, disciplined feeling to the day that could help you think realistically about your situation and where you want to go with it.",2,libra,2018
14,"This might be a good day to take some time for yourself, Libra. Contact with others, no matter how much you love them, isn't likely to go well, as most people are probably restless and in uncertain moods. This is a good day to catch up on your reading or web surfing and work on projects of your own that you may have been neglecting for a while. You can always contact your friends tomorrow!",2,libra,2018
15,"New enterprises that you've worked to perfect for a long time, perhaps involving writing, speaking, or publishing, might pay off today, Libra. Success definitely appears to be in the wind, and those in authority could be more than impressed with what you've been trying to achieve. Grab the gold ring now and take advantage of this opportunity, since it might be a long time before another one comes around. Onward and upward!",2,libra,2018
16,"Visitors in your home, perhaps invited by others in your household, could put a crimp in your desire to be alone and hash out your thoughts today, Libra. Your mind is sharp and ideas should come thick and fast. Don't get so irritated with the situation at home that you sabotage your plans. You might want to go off somewhere by yourself, possibly to simply sequester yourself in your own room.",2,libra,2018
17,"Don't expect any creative projects to go smoothly today, Libra. You could experience mental blocks that you find difficult to get beyond. Don't let it get to you. The blocks will pass. Just put the project aside and get back to it later. A phone call from a friend might bring some disconcerting news that could cause you to want to pass it on to others. Before you do, make sure you have the facts straight.",2,libra,2018
18,"Group activities involving meditation, psychic or spiritual topics, or artistic pursuits are probably very appealing to you right now, Libra. This is the perfect day to start a class or attend a lecture on such subjects. You could meet some interesting people who become close friends. You’re likely to feel a psychic bond with anyone you meet today, and you're likely to get the feeling that your life has changed for the better. Enjoy!",2,libra,2018
19,"The workplace could be very hectic today as a colleague prepares to leave on an important business trip, Libra. Nerves could be strained and tempers short. Try to stay focused and get everything necessary done without making yourself crazy. You may be the one who keeps everyone else from going crazy, although you might consider hiding in the closet yourself. Say a prayer of thanks when your colleague finally rides off in the taxi.",2,libra,2018
20,"Friction or other trouble on the job could cause you to want to quit, Libra, but worries about money might keep you from doing it. You definitely need to reassess your situation. Perhaps a change of position is just what you need now. You may have untapped talents that could make you more marketable, and you might also want to train those talents. Think about this! And if you really think you want a change, go for it.",2,libra,2018
21,"Your home could be a gloomy place today, Libra. A member of the household is likely to be away, and this person's presence is apt to be very sorely missed. The only thing you can do under the circumstances is make sure everyone keeps busy until the absent one returns. One way to distract the family is to get them to clean up the house in anticipation of a warm welcome!",2,libra,2018
22,"Today is the final push to complete a very big project you've likely been working on for some time now, Libra. Even though your name won’t be on the cover of the book or business proposal, you’re gratified to have played such a significant role in its completion. Be sure to have a nutritious breakfast and lunch today, because you’re likely to work right through dinner.",2,libra,2018
23,"Keep your eyes wide open today, Libra, as you may meet the person of your dreams! Or you could stumble, literally, upon a stack of cash. It’s likely to be a most unusual day, so keep your wits about you and your mind open to all possibilities. If an intriguing new business opportunity comes your way, don't accept it right immediately. Take down all the information and review it when life has settled down somewhat.",2,libra,2018
24,"Today you just might want to cut yourself off from the world and hide, Libra. Your backyard or bedroom seems especially attractive right now, and you might have just purchased a new paperback that you're dying to read. You won't even feel like sharing a meal with the rest of the household. Don't worry about this. We all want some time alone occasionally. Your family should understand.",2,libra,2018
25,"You’ve been working especially hard and you’re beginning to wonder if all your effort has been for naught. A restructuring at work leaves you wondering just exactly where you fit in or if you even fit in at all. You may have a troubling few days, Libra, but will be relieved to learn that the higher-ups have big plans for you in the newly organized, streamlined company.",2,libra,2018
26,"It’s likely that you’re feeling ready for a change, Libra. It isn’t that you’re dissatisfied with your job or environment, rather that your mind is hungry for new challenges. You may be able to satisfy this hunger by taking on more responsibility at work or signing up to attend some evening classes after work. Any new and different activity will give your mind the stimulation it craves.",2,libra,2018
27,"If a friend or colleague seems to be in trouble, you may not want to interfere for fear of being too intimate. But this isn't a time to hold back, Libra. It's likely that this person really does need your help. Your intervention will be much appreciated and possibly even rewarded. Be sure to get some rest tonight. You're emotionally and physically drained.",2,libra,2018
28,"Today, Libra, you might attend a group event of some kind. While there, you could encounter an old friend who seems to have changed. As a result, you might find this person very attractive and direct a rush of physical passion their way. This could be disconcerting, but don't brush it off because you've always thought of this person as a friend. The most successful marriages are the ones that start out as friendships.",2,libra,2018
1,"Today you could receive word of a promotion or exciting new challenge at work. Although this is something you've wanted for a long time, you may hesitate to accept immediately. Could it be because your self-confidence is rather low right now, Libra? Don't let that stop you! This feeling is only temporary, while the opportunity could develop into something lasting. Don't lose your chance!",3,libra,2018
2,"Boredom and restlessness may plague you today, Libra. You could feel the need to break loose from the ties that bind you to mundane affairs, to run away and seek adventure, although you aren't certain what kind of adventure! The walls may be closing around you at home and on the job. You might want to plan some kind of outing for an upcoming weekend in order to give yourself a needed break.",3,libra,2018
3,"Today is an active day for you in which you would do well working with groups of others, Libra. Your imagination is especially active and you might find yourself playing out scenes from your dreams. The people in your life are playing a more important role than they have in times past. Recognize and appreciate these key people. Work with them to lift the layer of fog that seems to be clouding the air today.",3,libra,2018
4,"Today you might feel stifled by your current situation. Perhaps you're thinking of changing jobs or professions, or maybe you're considering moving to a more exotic place. These all might be good ideas, Libra, but today isn't the day to make any definite decisions or even consider your options. You aren't in an objective frame of mind. Wait a few days and then think about this some more. You might change your mind.",3,libra,2018
5,"Paperwork regarding financial matters may need to be executed at some point today, Libra. You're in the mood for some adventure, perhaps physical or romantic. You might be tempted to participate in challenging sports, such as river rafting or downhill skiing, or you might decide to attend a group meeting and see what opportunities for contacts - not to mention romantic partners! - come your way. Take care! Have fun, but move ahead with caution.",3,libra,2018
6,"Put your wisdom into action, Libra. There is no good in accumulating knowledge and then letting it sit, collecting dust like an old book on a shelf. Put your thoughts into motion and watch as magical things begin to manifest before your eyes. You have incredible opportunities today that only come when you're expressing yourself in your truest form. Wear something outlandish to remind yourself and others what an outrageous person you are.",3,libra,2018
7,"Be careful of advertising yourself as someone who is so strong and mentally competent that you're capable of handling everything, Libra. Take note that the strongest mule on the trail usually ends up carrying the most weight. Your emotions are more sensitive than you may think, and certainly more than you demonstrate to others. Be honest about the way you feel and not just the way you think.",3,libra,2018
8,"You're likely to be on a roll with new and innovative ideas about your goals in life, Libra. Unfortunately, there are some obstacles. People who are scared of the new and different are apt to try to toss a monkey wrench into the spokes of your wheels. More than likely, these people are simply reacting out of fear of something they don't understand. Help them see your perspective.",3,libra,2018
9,"As someone who tends to operate through your intellect, Libra, you might be surprised by the surge of romantic passion that comes your way at this time. For today at least, your values might shift from the intellectual to the physical. You'll probably want to plan a romantic evening with someone special. You might even want to get out and spend some money on clothes. Enjoy your day.",3,libra,2018
10,"Action is the key word for you today, Libra, so put on some comfortable shoes and have a good time. Infuse a bit of non sequitur playfulness in your dealings with others. Find ways to escape reality for a little while. Take the original scenario and add a twist of the bizarre. Opinions will be especially strong today and conflict may arise, but realize that playfulness and lightheartedness will help any situation.",3,libra,2018
11,"A large force is gathering now to make a bold statement and important pledge, Libra. This kind of movement brings together generations and unites people in a revolution. Put away the petty issues and think globally. Educate yourself about what's going on in the world and take a more aggressive stand to fight for what you believe. A small group of intelligent individuals can make a tremendous impact.",3,libra,2018
12,"Why keep fighting a fight that you know you can't win, Libra? Why keep trying to fool yourself and others into thinking that you have all the answers when you're only aware of the tip of the iceberg? The mass of knowledge lies well beneath the surface. Instead of fighting, offer to surrender. At this point, others will be much more willing to quench your thirst for truth. The key for you is to listen.",3,libra,2018
13,"Other people are the most important aspect of your day today, Libra. You'll find that things might get a bit difficult and unruly alone, but if you connect with others, even the most challenging task becomes almost effortless. One toothpick is easily broken, but 50 toothpicks together are as strong as steel. Conjure up this power created by a force of people who all share a common goal.",3,libra,2018
14,"A group you're associated with could bring information to your attention that puts you in a very positive frame of mind and almost has you skipping all the way home. You should enjoy socializing today, Libra, as you're even more gregarious than usual. Both old and new friends could seek out your company. A victory of some kind has come your way, contributing to your great mood. Enjoy your day!",3,libra,2018
15,"Don't be surprised if you don't spend too much time at home today. All signs indicate that you're more likely to be out and about, shopping, visiting, and maybe attending a special dinner or concert. There are a number of family activities that you won't want to miss, Libra, so don't let your friends distract you with too much shopping or sports on TV.",3,libra,2018
16,"Body and soul might seem out of balance today. A part of you may long to break from society and live a more spiritual life, but worldly responsibilities and an attachment to your current lifestyle could get in your way. These things don't happen overnight, Libra. You have to let them develop in their own way, in their own time. Right now, find balance between the spiritual and the material.",3,libra,2018
17,"You should be feeling emotionally strong today, Libra, although you could find that an idea runs through your head that asks you to slow down and take things once step at a time. The internal dialogue could drive you crazy if you aren't careful. The most important thing to do now is simply follow your heart. Do what you love to do, and associate with the people you love and respect the most.",3,libra,2018
18,"Practical abilities that you didn't know you possessed might suddenly appear today, Libra. You could be working behind the scenes on a project of some kind, perhaps involving earning some extra money or raising funds for a worthy cause. Your intuition is operating at a high level, so don't be surprised if you tune in to the thoughts of others. Your imagination and inspiration are also on target. Make use of them!",3,libra,2018
19,"Feel free to match your plaid pants with your paisley shirt today, Libra. Accessorize with wild sneakers and a striped jacket. Let the oddball within you shine brightly! This is a terrific day for you, and you should feel free to express yourself openly and loudly to the world. You should experience a great deal of self-confidence. Take full advantage of it at this time.",3,libra,2018
20,"Today you could make the acquaintance of actors, musicians, or other performers, some of whom might be quite well known. Social occasions could bring valuable contacts your way, which you could make good use of later. You might be having so much fun out among the beautiful people that you really don't want to go home! Don't make it too late a night, however, Libra. You'll need all your energy tomorrow!",3,libra,2018
21,"You, along with a significant other in your life, could be very busy trying to make time to see each other today, Libra. Later, when you're finally alone, your phone could be ringing nonstop, further intruding upon your time together. Don't be afraid to turn it off! If a call is particularly important, they'll call again later.",3,libra,2018
22,"Good news! It looks as if money is coming your way. Perhaps you're getting a good bonus, or perhaps you've received a good review and will be getting a substantial raise. Hearing about this will definitely boost your mood, Libra, and because you're feeling good, you'll be especially nice to those around you. They'll reciprocate in kind. Enjoy your day!",3,libra,2018
23,"New discoveries that capture your imagination could find you spending most of your day sequestered in your home and learning as much as you can. All indications are that you aren't going to want to do much else, Libra, but it's important to remember to take breaks and get a little exercise throughout the day. Moving the body and shaking out the kinks in your muscles can get your mind going as well.",3,libra,2018
24,"A group activity could lead to discussions of famous unsolved mysteries, Libra. Jack the Ripper, the Black Dahlia, the truth about O.J. Simpson, and other intriguing problems might capture the interest of everyone present, and might lead to some animated debates over possible solutions. You might want to make mental notes of the ideas everyone comes up with. Each possible solution could tell you a lot about the person proposing it!",3,libra,2018
25,"Career matters may be put on hold today, as important communications you're expecting fail to come on time, Libra. As you're anxious to conclude the matters involved, you could make yourself crazy with frustration. Don't do this. Find something else to do while you're waiting and the time will pass more quickly. You'll get something done besides. Your primary concern will be resolved, just not when you'd hoped. Be patient!",3,libra,2018
26,"Assessment of others' ideas may be a main focus today, Libra. Group activities could require your intellectual input. A friend could come to you with an idea for a project of some kind. Writing or speaking may be involved in some way. Your friend isn't in a very practical frame of mind, so don't be surprised if the ideas don't seem very workable right now. Don't be discouraging, however. Your friend may surprise you!",3,libra,2018
27,"Today you could realize that a friend is actually your soul mate, Libra. You've been spending a lot of time together attending social events, and you've come to realize how much you look forward to each other's company. Your new level of affection seems obvious, but it would be a good idea to put it into words. If you can't screw up the courage to do so, express your thoughts with a gift.",3,libra,2018
28,"Have love matters been causing you excessive strain for a while, Libra? If so, you can expect that to end now. Someone you love deeply reciprocates your feelings, and is very anxious to resolve any differences between you and look toward the future. This relationship will probably succeed if you go in with eyes wide open. Don't have unrealistic expectations of your partner. Learn to love human flaws as much as perfection.",3,libra,2018
29,"Your visionary tendencies are in the ascendant today, Libra, although they take more of a practical than mystical bent. You might look at your living room or backyard and suddenly find yourself redecorating it in your mind's eye. If you've wanted to start some sort of long-term project to improve your surroundings, this is the day to get started. You'll not only attain your vision, you may surpass it. Have fun!",3,libra,2018
30,"If you're artistic by nature, Libra, expect a rush of inspiration to hit today, along with an irresistible compulsion to start a new project and work until you can see at least some results. If you've never been artistic before, you may suddenly feel like giving it a try, perhaps using computer technology. No matter what, you're likely to derive a lot of pleasure from it, so go to it. Have fun!",3,libra,2018
31,"An emotional phone call could come from a close friend or love partner, Libra. This person has a lot of worries, and is apt to lay them all on you if you let it happen. You won't want to drop everything that you'd planned to work on today. Tell your friend that you should get together for dinner or coffee and you'll talk about it, and then finish your tasks as quickly as possible.",3,libra,2018
1,"If you've been thinking about starting a new creative project, Libra, don't try to do it today. Friends and family could vie for your attention and distract you. Other responsibilities could interfere with your desire to get going on it now. Don't hesitate to try to come up with ideas, but you might have to wait until tomorrow to start the work. Tomorrow you should be raring to go. Be patient!",4,libra,2018
2,"It's generally quite clear that you aren't afraid to tell people what you think, Libra. Maybe it's time to be more expressive about how you feel. It could be that your mental process is a bit off today, jolted by an unexpected situation or person. Make sure you incorporate some of your instincts and emotions into your reaction to the situation. Don't rely on your brain alone to have all the answers.",4,libra,2018
3,"You might be hard and cold when it comes to the facts, Libra, and you could come across as tough and rather harsh. In reality, this often just masks your sensitive interior. Perhaps you're insecure about your feelings and how you express yourself. People might never know this because you're so good at showing only the strong-willed, electric side of your personality. Be careful of being too stingy about sharing yourself with others.",4,libra,2018
4,"Your imagination is your best friend, Libra. You aren't about to let anyone disturb your fantasy world. You have fit love and romance perfectly into this place, and everything is wonderful in your head. Implementing this plan and making it work in the real world are two different things, so try not to get too tied to this idea. Definitely aim to manifest your vision, but don't be unrealistic about it.",4,libra,2018
5,"You think of yourself as fairly modern in your thinking, don't you, Libra? But have you really been able to reject tradition entirely? Have you rid yourself of all the outmoded conventions that confined earlier generations? If not, today you'll be inspired to revamp your role models and lighten your workload. Equality in the home is just as important as equality in the workplace.",4,libra,2018
6,"The mood you're in today is the stuff of which memorable encounters are made. You'll be wary at first, perhaps even somewhat hostile, to anyone who dares intrude on your freedom. Then suddenly you'll realize that this person is someone special, intriguing, and definitely out of the ordinary. Finally, Libra, you'll realize that the qualities he or she offers just happen to be those you need the most right now.",4,libra,2018
7,"A colleague or possibly a romantic partner could be in a rather touchy mood today, Libra. Therefore, you might find this person difficult to deal with. You could get a bit irritated and wonder if this person is worth the aggravation he or she is causing you. Don't do anything foolish. This mood will pass. Try to stay out of your friend's way, if possible. All should be back to normal by tomorrow.",4,libra,2018

You're apt to learn a lot from them. Books could be involved in some way. You'll want to stay in touch with them, so be sure to get names, phone numbers or email addresses. This could open up some new doors for you.",4,libra,2018
9,"Daydreams full of adventure, perhaps involving travel, could take up a lot of your time today, Libra. You're probably bored with your situation and longing to do something to break your routine. You might have no idea how you can escape from everything right now. Don't force it. Spend the afternoon in a place you don't usually visit. You'll come up with a workable idea in due time. Go for it!",4,libra,2018
10,"This isn't a good day to visit the racetrack, Las Vegas, or any store that sells lottery tickets. Stay away from the stock market, too, Libra. Speculation of any kind now could be risky at best and disastrous at worst. Romance is also likely to be blocked today, since you're probably feeling a bit lethargic and not very sociable. Read a good book. That's the most productive thing you could do today!",4,libra,2018
11,"You could be surrounded by secrets, Libra. A number of colleagues might be leaving to pursue new opportunities, and you could wonder if there's a reason for it that escapes you. It might even have you reevaluating whether or not you should stay put! However, don't panic because others leave. If there are things about your job that bother you, by all means consider your options.",4,libra,2018
12,"Spiritual and psychic matters come to the forefront today, Libra. You could be greatly inspired to express yourself creatively. You could also be quite surprised at the wisdom you find within yourself. A gathering of friends, perhaps for the purpose of discussing metaphysical subjects, could bring this to your attention so blatantly that it becomes hard to ignore. Don't cling to the shore. Flow with the current.",4,libra,2018
13,"You're especially intuitive today, Libra. If this is a fairly new occurrence for you, you could be at a loss as to how to make the most of this gift. Only you can know for sure, but one suggestion is to reflect on changes that you'd like to make at work. Pitch them to your boss. With today's keen insight, you'll almost be able to read his or her mind and anticipate any objections.",4,libra,2018
14,"Today you could find yourself brainstorming a way to put your inventiveness and ingenuity to work so that you can advance your career by leaps and bounds and increase your income. You could also become involved in artistic projects of some kind. Don't be surprised if great ideas come to you with little effort. You're very intuitive today, Libra, so enjoy it.",4,libra,2018
15,"You can expect your life to change in a fairly dramatic way today, Libra. The change could be subtle at first, but with time and distance you're likely to look back on this day as pivotal. You could receive an intriguing piece of news that sets your head spinning with ideas. Perhaps you've been thinking of starting your own business, and today you have an idea. Maybe you meet someone who helps your career. Keep your mind open to the possibilities.",4,libra,2018
16,"This will be an exciting day for you intellectually, Libra. A number of intriguing concepts will catch your fancy, and you'll be hungry to learn more about them right away. Your research could take you to a library or onto the Internet. The topics might relate to social or political issues. As irresistible as these new ideas are, don't forget to tend to the business of everyday life.",4,libra,2018
17,"You're bound to be busy but happy today, Libra. You'll likely spend the morning doing chores and generally puttering around the house. Don't be surprised if a friend drops by unexpectedly in the afternoon with some important news to share. Your evening could be occupied doing research at the library or on the computer. It seems your friend's news piqued your curiosity about a particular subject.",4,libra,2018
18,"Today your strong sense of nostalgia likely has you leaning toward all things old. If you do some furniture shopping, you'll be drawn to antique shops rather than contemporary stores. There is something about the patina that only comes with age. This applies to people as well as objects, which may explain why you tend to prefer to be with people who are older than you.",4,libra,2018
19,"Today might be largely devoted to household tasks, Libra. It isn't exactly the most glamorous assignment, but you take a certain pleasure in attending to daily necessities. Pay some bills, throw in a few loads of laundry, do some yard work and cooking. Your partner or family will appreciate your efforts. It's even more fun if it isn't expected of you. And who knows? Maybe they'll reciprocate.",4,libra,2018
20,"Get out in the fresh air today in whatever way suits your fancy, Libra. It's important to exercise your body with some brisk physical activity, or at least refresh your spirit with a ride in a convertible. This is a terrific time for you. You feel alive and joyous about your life. Join with others to recognize all that you have, and give thanks for your meal tonight.",4,libra,2018
21,"Are you unhappy or uncertain about your current profession, Libra? Are you thinking of making a change? News could reach you today of possible avenues to explore, but you shouldn't make any decision today. Your mind isn't as objective as it should be to think through everything. Think about it, by all means, but wait a day or two before giving serious consideration to anything vital.",4,libra,2018
22,"Love and romance take top priority with you today, Libra. You might be feeling a little insecure about the stability of your current relationship, but you're wasting your energy. For now, at least, things look very promising for you and your current lover. You should be communicating well and getting along great. Use your intuition to tune in to your friend's mind, and you'll probably feel your doubts and uncertainties slip away. Enjoy your day.",4,libra,2018
23,"Have you been waiting to hear about some funds, Libra, perhaps to create a piece of art, write a book, or make a documentary film? If so, you could have a lot to celebrate today when you receive news that the money is forthcoming! Don't be surprised if there's a delay, however. The project is still going to happen, but just a little later than you'd hoped. All you can do now is be patient.",4,libra,2018
24,"You feel that life would run more smoothly if money didn't exist! The amount of time and energy you spend sorting out your financial affairs is frustrating. Unfortunately, Libra, today will be a frustrating day. Today you need to sit down and sort out some neglected bills. It isn't fun, but at least by the end of the day you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you got it done.",4,libra,2018
25,"Just how long has it been since you indulged in a big helping of your favorite guilty pleasure, Libra? It's time to let the youngster in you come out and play today. Eat that chocolate, read those mindless magazines, or skip down the sidewalk. You've been taking life much too seriously lately. Even grownups are entitled to indulge in the pleasures of youth from time to time.",4,libra,2018
26,"If you come across someone a little strange or eccentric today, try and get to know him or her, because that person could be a reflection of part of you. The person will help you to see how modern and innovative you are, and how much you should appreciate your wonderful qualities. Meeting this person could be a kind of exercise in self-satisfaction.",4,libra,2018
27,"You're likely to feel optimistic and enthusiastic about life today, Libra. You might also feel especially sexy, a feeling you should definitely take advantage of! Why not plan a romantic evening with your loved one? Don't hesitate to talk about your travel dreams over dinner. You never know, he or she just might share your dream. Before you know it, the two of you could be winging your way to exotic lands.",4,libra,2018
28,"A colleague's motives could seem rather sinister today, Libra. This person has a definite agenda of his or her own that may not take into account the needs or feelings of anyone who could conceivably stand in the way. This person isn't to be trusted. Don't excuse his or her behavior. The best course of action now is to stay out of the way and protect yourself on all levels.",4,libra,2018
29,"Your curiosity and creative energy may be stimulated today by information you receive from books, documentaries, or conversations with people familiar with the field you're exploring. As a result, Libra, you could come up with an innovative new project that keeps you and some colleagues busy for a long time. But don't worry - this enterprise should be full of surprises and therefore anything but tedious. Go to it!",4,libra,2018
30,"A friend or romantic partner might need your advice, Libra, and want to discuss a few things that you don't really understand. This could concern this person's job, which involves a lot of technicalities with which you're unfamiliar. Don't be afraid to stop occasionally and ask for an explanation. If you're going to be of any help, you have to have some idea of what this person is talking about.",4,libra,2018
1,"If you happen to be training for a new trade, learning a new technique, or perhaps you're being evaluated after an internship period, you can expect these pursuits to conclude on a high note. You may have been somewhat afraid that those in authority would frown upon your originality, Libra. On the contrary, it seems the people in charge appreciate it more than you know.",5,libra,2018
2,"You should use the day to ponder your professional future, Libra. Many forces seem to be working together to clarify your ideas on the subject. Rather than rebelling at the slightest provocation, as you've been doing lately, it would be much more reasonable for you to think first about the basic material needs of you and your family.",5,libra,2018
3,"You might feel as if your powerful emotions are getting in the way of your dreams, Libra. Or perhaps you're finding that you're so wrapped up in a particular vision of the future that you're getting lost in your own brain. You're losing touch with the present simply because you're so focused on a nebulous idea that doesn't even exist yet. Take a step back from your current mindset and reevaluate the situation.",5,libra,2018
4,"You are an excellent friend, and you take pride in helping the people around you. Have you ever thought about getting involved in a humanitarian cause or giving a few hours of your time every week to your local community? Today, Libra, these kinds of ideas could become a real part of your life. It's time to use all of your great ideas to help others.",5,libra,2018
5,"A gloomy guest could arrive today, Libra, and likely need some cheering up. Do the best you can, but don't try to do it by cooking a meal. The results of your efforts might not be all that exciting. This is a great day to go for fast food. Take your friend to a movie, concert, or art gallery. This could get your mind off his or her troubles and your mind off your friend!",5,libra,2018
6,"A talent for interior decoration that you may or may not have been aware of could inspire you to do some work on your home. You'll probably consider a lot of different options and make long lists of possibilities, Libra. Discussions with friends and family members can bring new ideas to mind. You might want to take a chance and try something a little different. Go to it and have fun.",5,libra,2018
7,"Your upbeat, lively nature is fueled by the fast-paced energy at hand. You have a great deal of physical strength available to you, Libra, and you can make tremendous strides in your yearly goals with very minimal effort. Take advantage of this time by focusing on your own needs. There is a great deal of support in place that will help you accomplish whatever your goals may be. Go for it.",5,libra,2018
8,"The notion of truth could get shot down today due to someone who knows you better than most, Libra. It won't take a long, drawn-out conversation or deep explanation to reveal the fact that there is a bit of deception that has been covering the truth. Don't try to hide from loved ones who are only trying to do what's best for you. Be open and honest with those who really care.",5,libra,2018
9,"You might be tempted to settle certain matters by radical means. The visionary part of you means you're painfully aware of the world's wrongs. You see no reason not to take action to correct them. But the forces in play are so powerful that you can't expect to institute a new order in one day. If you have an emotional question to resolve, it would be better to wait a few days before making a decision.",5,libra,2018
10,"Who would have guessed that you have an ability to understand subjects as irrational as human passions? You're getting down and dirty with the sticky, trivial realities of day-to-day life that never interested you before. Your new nonstick coating would make you an excellent personnel director, hiring and firing at the drop of a hat. Has that thought ever occurred to you?",5,libra,2018
11,"Today's aspects will clarify any team situations of which you're a part, Libra. This could concern teams in your private or professional life. This is the moment to take action. Make use of any benefits gleaned from your reflections of the past few days. Don't be afraid to modify what is already in place. If you hesitate, you will only succeed in making yourself more anxious.",5,libra,2018
12,"Today is going to be an excellent day for meeting interesting people, Libra. And there will be nothing superficial about these encounters. On the contrary, the people you are going to meet will touch you profoundly and move you deeply on an emotional level. But don't let yourself be seduced by ideas alone! Practicality matters, too!",5,libra,2018
13,"Your creative talents should be operating at an all-time high today, Libra. You might be offered an opportunity to earn some money putting them to use.

Your intuition is also operating at a high level, boosting your imagination and relations with others. Enjoy your day!",5,libra,2018
14,"Intimacy will be in the air over the next few days. Loved ones suddenly want to spend more time with you, and you'll want to invite friends over every night! By all means, do. You'll be recharged, and some of the wonderful discussions could lead to something great. However, there may be a bit of tension in the air to temper all that closeness, since not everyone will agree with your point of view.",5,libra,2018
15,"You may feel hemmed in by the role models that society currently offers, Libra. As you struggle to find your own definition of the truly modern human being, the people around you sometimes criticize your liberated attitude. Just because their ideas aren't in sync with yours in no way invalidates them. If your ideas are a tad too radical, theirs are too conventional. There's room for both points of view.",5,libra,2018
16,"The mood you're in today is the stuff of which memorable encounters are made, Libra. You'll be wary at first, perhaps even somewhat hostile to someone who dares to intrude on your freedom. Then suddenly you'll realize that this person is someone special, intriguing, and definitely out of the ordinary. Finally, you'll see that the qualities they offer just happen to be what you need most right now.",5,libra,2018
17,"You may need to take a more disciplined approach to your communication today, Libra. Try not to be so harsh and limiting with your words. People respond better to comforting expressions and a sympathetic tone. Cold, abrasive facts will only aggravate an existing wound. Tone things down. Allot yourself some quiet time to be alone and contemplate your state of mind.",5,libra,2018
18,"Overall, the climate is tense at work and at home, Libra. You'll sense a feeling of restlessness and a longing for change, but you'll also feel a reluctance to make any real moves in that direction. Your judgment tells you that complaints that don't lead to action are meaningless. So why not be the catalyst that provokes some action?",5,libra,2018
19,"Sometimes you feel like you're navigating through a thick fog, but the obscurity will finally lift today. The skies ahead are sunny and clear! You can expect an invitation to take a little trip or an offer to belong to a special group. Don't pass up any opportunities to have fun, Libra. You can benefit from a diversion right now!",5,libra,2018
20,"You will find that disciplined actions are the best way to go about your day today, Libra. Stay focused on your path. You can accomplish many tasks at the same time if you play your cards right. Try not to get bogged down with details. People might cause you to worry too much. Don't let their energy get in the way of your progress.",5,libra,2018
21,"Your strong opinions might come into conflict with strong emotions today, Libra. Be aware that fountains of intensity are likely to spring from you as if you were a bottomless well. Realize that you might need pay less attention to your logic today and concentrate on your heart. It could be hard to reason with people. If your heart doesn't support what you say, you might as well not say it.",5,libra,2018
22,"Today's prospects should suit the dynamic, idealistic being that you are, especially right now. There will be some criticism in the air, and you won't miss an opportunity to punctuate your comments with your famous irony. Your viewpoints on corporate rigidity and conformist attitudes are well known, but today your sense of humor prevails and people listen to you with pleasure!",5,libra,2018
23,"You may have the intellectual side of the equation completely set in your head, Libra. You've collected all the facts and have all the data worked out in such a way that it's impossible for anyone to fault your calculations. Don't think you're done, because there's one part of the picture left to consider - emotions. Extreme feelings could put a monkey wrench in your plans. Be prepared.",5,libra,2018
24,"Tension is apt to build to a high level if you aren't careful about how you use words, Libra. The tricky thing is that forces are going to try to push you and pull you in different ways. You may encourage a focus on the collective, while others worry only about themselves. Still another force calls for outdated remedies and traditional structures that no longer work for you. Blaze your own trail!",5,libra,2018
25,"Libra, you may feel a little tired and depressed over breakfast this morning. Domestic responsibilities sometimes overload your spirit. How about treating yourself to a short vacation - a little free time just for you? You can justify it because it's vital for your morale. Perhaps you can use the time off to draw up a weekly schedule and make your workload seem less daunting.",5,libra,2018
26,"Strong forces may be acting up and asking you to stand up a little straighter than usual, Libra. Keep your shoulders back and be proud.

Don't back down, but be prepared to fight.",5,libra,2018
27,"You may have had a hard time launching long-term personal projects lately, Libra. Today marks a critical starting point toward attaining your goals.

Move forward with projects that you've put off because they were too frustrating to deal with.",5,libra,2018
28,"Don't try to force your ideas on anyone, Libra. It's important to maintain neutrality so you can act from a stable state of mind when someone brings you an issue that needs to be dealt with right away. The key is to act rather than react to a situation. If you know you're right about something, keep it to yourself. There's no need to rub it in anyone's face and tell them they're wrong.",5,libra,2018
29,"It's an excellent forecast for you, Libra! Although no specific events will occur, there is the huge promise of freedom over the next seven months. A fundamental shift is about to occur in your occupation and love life, As the months unfold, you can expect to be more visionary, more creative, and perhaps more rebellious. This time, you'll be much more effective than in the past two or three years.",5,libra,2018
30,"Don't let things bother you, Libra. Have confidence that you're on the right track. Your strong will and erratic habits will prove quite effective on a day like today, when things seem to be floundering and indecision abounds. Take this opportunity to grab the reins where other people have dropped them. You might be on center stage. This is fine, because you know exactly what to say.",5,libra,2018
31,"It may be hard to find answers today, Libra. It may also be hard for you to get your point across, especially since everyone's head is way up in the clouds. Don't be surprised if your own head takes a trip up there as well. You're better off giving it a boost up there instead of trying to force it back down to reality. Check things out from a different perspective.",5,libra,2018
1,"This is one of those days in which you might not be fully appreciated for the wonderful breath of fresh air you bring to the group, Libra. Revenge of the stale and old may be coming into the fold today. Don't give in to negative forces trying to keep you from fully expressing yourself. Have confidence that you have what it takes to be successful in whatever path you decide to follow.",6,libra,2018
2,"Important enterprises centering on your home could take up a lot of your energy over the next few days, Libra. Many people might come and go. Perhaps you're hosting a significant social event, moving to a nicer place, or maybe transacting a lot of business in your home. Whatever it is, it's likely to produce the results you're hoping for. Work hard and make the most of it.",6,libra,2018
3,"You usually tend toward rational and scientific ways of thinking, Libra, but today you might be so intuitive that you're more likely to use your psychic abilities. This can be a mixed blessing. Your rational nature protects you from identifying too much with the world's less fortunate. Today this protection is greatly lessened, so be prepared to emotionally identify with everybody.",6,libra,2018
4,"Today you might feel a powerful need to write down your thoughts, Libra, but they could prove a bit too amorphous for you to put into words. You might also have difficulty making contact with friends or loved ones. You may keep missing each other. Getting around in neighborhood traffic could prove frustrating. In spite of small irritations, this should be an enjoyable day. Hang in there.",6,libra,2018
5,"Oppressive stress on you or those close to you could cause disconcerting upsets within your relationships today, Libra. Try to be objective and work things out rationally instead of going to pieces. Avoid being sucked into quarrels where you might say things you'll regret. Don't let this temporary situation get the best of you. Make the effort to stay focused and relaxed. Tomorrow all should be back to normal.",6,libra,2018
6,"The approaching arrival of visitors, perhaps in relation to a group activity or social event you're hosting, could necessitate a last-minute cleanup and perhaps even a little redecorating. More than one person is likely to come to your door today, Libra, and all who visit are likely to bring interesting news and useful information. By day's end your energy and enthusiasm should be much higher than they were in the morning.",6,libra,2018
7,"A lot of visitors may come to your home today, Libra. Land might be discussed. At some point you'll be reminded of someone from the past and experience a momentary wave of longing to see this person again. This won't last, however. You'll be too busy relating to those present now. Expect to learn a lot and accomplish more throughout the course of the day. Go for the gold.",6,libra,2018
8,"A neighbor or relative you haven't spoken to for a while might suggest attending a social event together, Libra. Make the time, as it could open up doors for you that you wouldn't normally expect. Relationships of all kinds should be going especially well, and these include romantic ones. If you're involved, expect to grow closer. If you aren't currently involved, don't be surprised if someone new and exciting enters your life.",6,libra,2018
9,"Today, Libra, you'll undoubtedly ask yourself a lot of questions. You tend to be rather introverted, and you typically need a great deal of freedom.

Take time today to analyze your commitments to others.",6,libra,2018
10,Today you may be wondering just how much you should get involved in a certain conflict between family members or in your career. There's a lot of pressure on you to find an answer to this problem. But all you have to do is not take sides and everything should work out fine. You may finally realize that it's probably best to just let things happen for once.,6,libra,2018
11,You've always felt the need to free yourself from society. You need to feel independent at any cost. You may need to face certain relationship problems at this time. Perhaps you're hesitant to commit either at work or in your personal life. You may ask yourself if your attitude isn't in fact revealing a desire to get away from it all. Perhaps you'll find the answer today.,6,libra,2018
12,"Today your emotional intuition intensifies your mental abilities, Libra. Friends and family members are likely to grow closer to you. You may be more aware of what they really need and want, and they could see you in a new light. This can make you feel loved and wanted. The downside is that your empathy is so high that you may pick up on everyone's aches and pains. Try to keep yourself bathed in the white light.",6,libra,2018
13,"Home and family are apt to be your primary focus today, Libra. Work around the house might take up a lot of your time. You might want to spruce up the place and make it more beautiful.

Your creative impulses regarding food are at an all-time high.",6,libra,2018
14,"Your day has finally come, Libra. You have your own vision of life and you like sharing it with others.

16,"Today you might decide to help someone with repairs or decorating in their home or perhaps a church or school. You'll have a lot of good ideas welling up from deep within you, Libra, and be astute enough to put them to work in the real world. You might not feel much like talking, however. Therefore don't be surprised if communication is more subtle than overt today.",6,libra,2018
17,"A lot of serious matters are on your mind, perhaps involving plans for the future. It's likely that you'll want to stay home today and do some contemplating. Various new opportunities could be coming your way, Libra, and you won't want to let them pass you by without serious consideration. Chores around the house could prove a valuable outlet for physical energy while allowing thoughts to churn in your mind.",6,libra,2018
18,"A lot of people around you might think that you are a strong individual, Libra. For example, you stand up against wrongs in the established social order. You can also be a very constructive person. You try to improve the world around you. Today, Libra, you'll have all the time you like to meditate about the changes this world needs.",6,libra,2018
19,"Scientists are sometimes pretty strange. They can be so engrossed in reality that they seem almost absent from it, as if they float above the Earth. That's a bit how you feel about things, too, Libra. You like to explain the world in your own special way, the way you see it and not necessarily the way it really is. That's your secret. You know that no one else can see the world the way you do.",6,libra,2018
20,"You're an eccentric person, Libra. Yet you also feel the need to be loved and feel the approval of those around you. It isn't always easy to think differently from other people or to feel completely different. In order to be accepted, you must help them understand you. Try to express your ideas and opinions in a more realistic way. You can't live out of sync all the time.",6,libra,2018
21,"A troubled night with little sleep could have you feeling out of sorts and not like doing much socializing today. If you can, Libra, work on projects at home alone where you can stop and take a nap if you want.

22,"Arguments that have been brewing are coming to a climactic point for you, Libra. Don't be surprised if heated opposition rears its head today. This is likely a result of your own doing. Cycles of anger are reaching a critical point, and your stubborn character is butting heads with an equally strong force. Try not to take yourself too seriously. Life is meant to be fun. Our objective is to be happy.",6,libra,2018
23,"Try not to be too fixed in your attitude today, Libra. Realize that you may have to give a little in order to work comfortably with the people around you. It's important that you be slow and reserved in your moves, especially in matters of the heart. Be open and receptive. Try not to scare anyone away with abrasive words or insisting that you're always right.",6,libra,2018

Now is the time when you need to lay some solid groundwork for those ideas to manifest.",6,libra,2018

When they resurface again, they could be even harder to handle.",7,libra,2018
3,"Pay attention to the news today, Libra. Be sure to check not just the mainstream news but also the offbeat independent publications and websites. Question what you hear and read.

6,"If people hassle you or give you a hard time about your appearance today, pay them no mind, Libra. You have the right to live your life any way you want to.

22,"A conference of some kind could touch upon some pretty volatile issues, Libra. People could disagree to the point that the meeting turns into a shouting match.

Think about it!",9,libra,2018

Needless to say, this is a great day to shop for clothes!",9,libra,2018
25,"Working late, Libra? What could be so important that it keeps you from paying attention to your family or partner? Probably nothing!

26,"If you aren't the most self-assured person in the world, Scorpio, take a look around and see all that you've done.

28,"You might need to take a step back today and turn your attention inward instead of outward. When it comes to love and romance, don't rush things. Patience is needed now more than ever.

3,"Business colleagues or prospective partners could visit today. The meeting promises to be cooperative, rewarding, and fruitful.

4,"A group activity, perhaps a festival of some kind, could bring new information and people into your life. You could meet people from all over the world and lifestyles.

7,"Your emotions are piqued today. You're spurred to take action. People might have a me-first attitude that may get on your nerves.

Stick to your principles and act confidently.",10,scorpio,2017
8,"You tend to be unconventional, but today you could outdo even you. A spiritual experience could be at the heart of it. You're changing in ways that are obvious to everyone.

The transition may be strange, but the butterfly is far lovelier than the caterpillar!",10,scorpio,2017
9,"Know what you're getting yourself into, especially if it has to do with love and romance. You may be like a fly on a tree branch, carefully inspecting the beautiful spider web at your feet.

15,"Dark dreams may haunt your sleep and cause you to awaken in the night.

You'll enjoy dancing the night away!,10,scorpio,2017

27,"You likely want to take the day off, perhaps to take care of an unfinished creative project you've been working on for some time.

Don't lose sight of your goals.",10,scorpio,2017
30,"It's important to remain flexible, but not so much that you can't make a decision about anything. Your head says one thing while your heart says another. When you give both of them free rein in an effort to be as flexible as possible, they go in opposite directions. Postpone making any important decisions until your path becomes clearer.",10,scorpio,2017
31,"It's an excellent day for you! Although no major events occur today, there's the promise of freedom in the coming months. A fundamental shift is about to occur in your occupation and love life.

5,"The climate is tense today. You'll be aware of a feeling of restlessness and a longing for change, but you'll also be reluctant to make any real moves in that direction.

6,Group activities or meetings could prove fraught today as those around you get pulled into discussions about which they feel strongly and on which they don't all agree!

9,Long-term trends are lining up in your favor. You're at a pivotal point in which you can latch onto something big and take off with it. Let your dreams expand. Telling people how to run their lives will get you nowhere. Lead by example. Follow your creative intuition and explore more of the things that make you truly happy.,11,scorpio,2017
10,"A new romance could come your way. An old friend could suddenly seem like more to you, sending the relationship in an entirely new direction. The opposite could happen, too.

You're the type to welcome it!",11,scorpio,2017
11,"Today you should feel especially idealistic, imaginative, intuitive, and spiritually inclined.

If nothing else, you'll learn something about yourself by being more attentive to your thoughts and emotions.",11,scorpio,2017
16,"There's power when you discover how to be part of two opposing teams. At first it may seem like treason to be part of one as you help the other.

21,"Certain areas of your life are expanding rapidly, causing you to lose touch with the more romantic aspects.

Their homes get messy, too!",11,scorpio,2017

This attitude won't serve you today.",12,scorpio,2017

The unexpected adventures you encounter will keep you entertained. Don't worry about the consequences. Go out and have fun. The energy of the day is electric!",12,scorpio,2017
18,"You should try to hold your tongue today. Although you think you have all the answers, you might not have taken all the pieces of the puzzle into account. There is an emotional aggression to the day that may have a strong effect on everyone, especially you. Consider being more of a listener than a talker.",12,scorpio,2017
19,"There's a somber mood hindering your emotions today, but things favor you generally. The contacts you make now can be extremely valuable. You could gain a great deal of information from social interactions. This is a good day to multitask and cross as many things off your list as possible.",12,scorpio,2017
20,"The day may barely get started unless you center yourself and ground your powerful emotions. Your usual detachment may help you deal with issues on a cerebral level, but today you need to be more emotionally receptive. Do what you can to bring more stability to your life. Take an aggressive stance toward completing any practical matters that are clamoring to get done.",12,scorpio,2017
21,"Keep things light and uplifting today. If you're open to new ways of doing things, revolutionary thoughts may come to you. It would behoove you to anticipate the future and nip any potential problems in the bud. The same conventional method that has been working for years may not be the best solution for the job. Seek other methods.",12,scorpio,2017
22,"Old demons and dreams are on the agenda today. Do you want to be an artist? Are you sure? If you're an artist, would you like to be more prominent or rich? Be wary of such daydreams because they take you away from enjoying your life. Live in the here and now. Embracing what you already have will ultimately give you the same satisfaction as those who are richer or more famous.",12,scorpio,2017
23,Your inner child surfaces today. Memories of past good times bring out your playful side. You might want to try forms of amusement that you once enjoyed but have long since abandoned. Children provide inspiration and outlet for this energy. Tell them stories about your own childhood or read to them. Indulge your flights of fancy. You can always face reality tomorrow.,12,scorpio,2017
24,You may have recently modified the material aspects of your life. Was it sufficient to stop there? More profound changes might be in order. Take a look at what motivated you to create the life you're living now. Pay special attention to the choices you've made in your profession. Are you sure you're doing what you were meant to do? Are you using your talents to the fullest?,12,scorpio,2017
25,"This is a terrific day for you. Your emotional state of mind is wonderfully upbeat. Things should be flowing your way, and there's an instinctual knowing that will help you navigate through whatever rough spots may come your way, if any. Take this opportunity to secure commitments from others and nail down plans that you intend to complete.",12,scorpio,2017
26,"Career or family? Social recognition or personal gratification? You may feel torn between two poles and spend the better part of the day searching for answers to such questions. Now you're trying to keep all the bases covered, but the weariness you feel on days like this is a hint that you need to make some wise, realistic changes for the future.",12,scorpio,2017
27,"Do you have the blues? It happens to everyone. Call a friend or go to a movie. Get out and do things that you know can help you overcome this funk. This isn't the moment to retreat. You have some inner work to do, even if it appears to lead nowhere. You may have the impression of being abandoned, but you know perfectly well that this isn't true.",12,scorpio,2017
28,"You might need to adopt a stern attitude today in order to be as effective as you'd like to be. When dealing with others, don't make assumptions for which you don't have solid backing. Other people are easily touched off, so keep things limited to the facts. Try not to stir up heavy emotions.",12,scorpio,2017
29,"Optimism and foresight are important today, as you take charge of your life and seek new opportunities. Conversations lead to ideas for possible personal and career expansion, and you're likely to send out and receive a number of messages. You could even be considering a move, perhaps to another city. Don't rush. Plan carefully and all should work out as you wish.",12,scorpio,2017
30,"Take a break from the trail you're on and get off the beaten path, Scorpio. Today is a day to forge ahead with ideas and dreams rather than commitments and answers. Question things and debate the facts. Whatever you do, have fun. This is the perfect day to go out and enjoy the fresh air with an outdoor activity, especially group activities. You can't go wrong with joining up with friends and chatting away about the latest events of your life.",12,scorpio,2017
31,"A rather disheartening phone call could come to you today, Scorpio. This might bring news of a setback in one of your projects that is only temporary but nonetheless frustrating. You'll probably have to deal with some trivial little details you'd rather not bother with, and this could take up too much valuable time. Hang in there - you're still doing well! Don't let your frustrations get the best of you.",12,scorpio,2017
1,"Some good news may reach your ears via the grapevine regarding your career. This might involve a raise in salary, Scorpio, or it could be new benefits, new profit sharing plans, or anything that may involve investments or money that comes your way above and beyond a paycheck. Contracts or other legal papers that are executed today should definitely work in your favor, so if you've been putting off signing any, do it today!",1,scorpio,2018
2,"You really don't need to prove anything to anyone, Scorpio. You may be feeling under a bit of pressure to get a lot of work done. But some projects, especially those that require creativity, simply can't be rushed. You will find that if you take your time and allow your muse to work its magic, you will produce something of real merit in the end. If, however, you try to rush, your time will likely be spent in vain.",1,scorpio,2018
3,"Romance is very much highlighted today, Scorpio. All the planetary energies indicate that you and your partner are operating on precisely the same wavelength. It's no wonder that the two of you have been getting along so well lately. Perhaps it's time to take the next important step in your relationship. No matter at what stage you are, there is always a higher plane to aspire to. Begin now and you can be assured that you will both enjoy the altitude.",1,scorpio,2018
4,"The people you meet today could be of tremendous benefit to you later on, Scorpio. You have especially keen vision today, so make sure to take note of everything of interest that you observe. What you discover today, along with the people you meet, could combine in a powerful way at some future date. Your work also benefits from your attention to detail.",1,scorpio,2018
5,"Generally, you tend to be rather ingenious where work is concerned, Scorpio, but today you may feel that the fountain of innovation has totally dried up. No matter how hard you try, you probably won't be able to muster any new ideas whatsoever. Chances are your biorhythms are low, and therefore your mind is working at a slower pace than usual. Concentrate on routine tasks today. By tomorrow your ingenuity should be back on track.",1,scorpio,2018
6,"Some kind of unexpected shakeup could take place today, Scorpio, and you could find yourself suddenly being offered more money or responsibilities. This might be just the break you've been waiting for, but it could take you so much by surprise that you might ask for time to think about it. Don't think for too long, however, because they might give the break to someone else!",1,scorpio,2018
7,"We are all gullible to a certain extent. And you are no exception. You can expect to receive some financial offers today. They may come via the mail or an in-person sales pitch. Trust your instincts here. Some of what is being offered may really be too good to be true. However, on the home front, what is being offered is genuine through and through. There is passion in the air to go along with all this integrity!",1,scorpio,2018
8,"Your ingenuity and imagination may seem to have deserted you today, Scorpio, and this isn't making it easy for you to produce the high level of quality you're used to at work. Perhaps it might be best to busy yourself with routine tasks you can do automatically and, if you can, put off the more creative endeavors until your brain gets back in gear. Don't be too proud or too shy to ask for help. Hang in there.",1,scorpio,2018
9,"It's time once and for all to tie up all those loose ends of projects left undone. Much as you may dread it, think of it this way, Scorpio: by completing these tasks you clear space for exciting new projects to come your way. Know that everything bodes well today for all things financial and professional. Perhaps you'll get that bonus that's due you!",1,scorpio,2018
10,"Are you expecting visitors, Scorpio? If so, you might go into a panic because your house isn't as spotless and beautiful as you would like it to be. You might be tempted to take broom, mop, and pail and whip through the place like a cyclone! Don't try to do too much. Your guests won't care if the unused back bedroom is messy or not. You'll want to have enough energy to enjoy their company. Take care!",1,scorpio,2018
11,"A financial windfall might be in the stars for you, Scorpio. This isn't anything you would have expected. Perhaps it's a bonus, repayment of a loan you'd long since forgotten, or a settlement of some kind. Whatever it is, it will definitely be a pleasant surprise. Don't, however, spend it all in one place. Wait a few days and then consult a professional about your financial future. This could make a big difference to you. Don't throw it away.",1,scorpio,2018
12,"Recent successes in your career might inspire you to throw a celebration of some kind with a few close friends, Scorpio. You're feeling especially positive and particularly charming at this time, and your confidence is likely to contribute to a new sense of closeness to those around you.

13,"A strange communication could come from a person who doesn't leave a name and whose voice you don't recognize, Scorpio. It might, however, sound important and therefore could bother you throughout the afternoon. How can you return a call when you don't know who the person is? Don't make yourself crazy. This isn't worth agonizing over. If it's important, the person will call back. Remember that as you move through the day.",1,scorpio,2018
14,"Visitors to your home today might engage you in discussions of innovative ways to increase your income, Scorpio. This may either be through the use of computers or through other forms of modern technology. You might find that you have a talent for such activity that you never realized before. You also might be enticed into going to a meeting or lecture on the subject. Open up your mind, but don't put your money where your mouth is yet!",1,scorpio,2018
15,"Your logical mind might try to make rational sense of the strange metaphysical ideas that are popping in and out of your head today, Scorpio. Some of them might be conclusions drawn from books you've been reading, but others might actually be messages from the other side. Write down whatever insights come your way. They might not seem logical, but they'll make a difference to your life. In the evening, discuss these ideas with a love partner.",1,scorpio,2018
16,"Blocks and obstacles that you may have reached with regard to your projects might cause you to wonder if you have what it takes to get them done at all, Scorpio. This is OK, but don't get caught up in doubting your abilities. Step back, be objective, and work out the most practical and efficient ways to get past the obstacles and attain the results you want. Don't let your insecurities get the best of you.",1,scorpio,2018
17,"Projects of all kinds that you could be working on with partners or friends could go especially smoothly today, Scorpio, as your thinking is especially sharp, clear, and logical. You and your friends are in an especially strong place right now, with trust and respect between you at an all-time high. Social events could bring stimulating discussions and stronger bonds between you and others. Work hard, but enjoy every minute of it.",1,scorpio,2018
18,"Today you might turn your attention toward discovering new ways to advance yourself financially, Scorpio. You're likely to be more aware than usual of your inner power. Reading about various possibilities could be enlightening, especially as you're feeling particularly capable today and therefore more likely to be able to zero in on whatever method is best for you. You might want to sequester yourself from everybody in order to be able to concentrate.",1,scorpio,2018
19,"Over the last few weeks, you may have made some good progress in learning to express your emotions, Scorpio. The great thing is that you probably didn't even notice! But if you aren't careful, there may be some bullheaded person around you today who may try and destroy all the progress you've made. Don't confuse controlling your emotions with repressing them. It's up to you to protect all the progress you've made.",1,scorpio,2018
20,"Have you been wanting to talk to your partner about something important, Scorpio? Well, it's up to you to make the first move. In fact, that's just what your partner is waiting for you to do. Take advantage of your day today to tell your partner exactly what you expect from him or her and to share some of your worries. You're someone who is lucky enough to know what you want, but it isn't always easy for you to tell other people what that is. Be strong.",1,scorpio,2018
21,"Social events, probably family related, could take up a lot of your time today, Scorpio. They might involve outings, perhaps to parks or other recreational areas. You'll enjoy it, but your mind may be on other matters, possibly projects you're involved with. Some stimulating conversations with someone close to you could take place. By day's end, your mind could be going a thousand miles an hour. Be sure to get a little exercise so you can sleep.",1,scorpio,2018
22,"A festive social event could either start or consolidate a love relationship, which could last for a long time. New and interesting people could come into your life, Scorpio, bringing stimulating conversation and useful information.

Enjoy your day.",1,scorpio,2018
23,"You should be feeling especially strong and healthy today, Scorpio. The drive to exercise, particularly if you do it alone and outdoors, is likely to get the endorphins going and thus give you a natural high, which could lead to an increased level of inspiration and intuition. After you finish, it might be a good idea to sit in a park, preferably near water, to allow yourself to come down. Meditate and take a close look at your inner state.",1,scorpio,2018
24,"Come out of your shell today and try not to be so aloof, Scorpio. You will never find the exact path you want to be on until you explore the different options. The good news is that you should be feeling quite strong emotionally, giving you the confidence to approach people with authority, thereby earning their respect and faith in whatever project you're involved with now.",1,scorpio,2018
25,"Some good but surprising news about a group with which you may be affiliated could come your way today, Scorpio. Perhaps fundraising activities have been more successful than you thought, or perhaps recognition is coming your way. A lot of paperwork may have to be completed before this can be made to work for you, however. Contracts or other legal papers might be involved. In the evening, go out with your friends and celebrate.",1,scorpio,2018
26,"Using computers either to increase your income or manage your money may have seemed like Greek to you, Scorpio, but today you'll probably catch on very quickly. Your natural practicality joins with an enhanced intellect and heightened intuition to give you an advantage you don't usually have. If you concentrate on learning it all today, it'll probably continue to be useful for you for a long time. Go to it!",1,scorpio,2018
27,"This is a good time for you to subscribe to some sort of magazine or newsletter that will keep you abreast of current events and developments in a field or hobby that interests you, Scorpio. The operative word of the day is ""new."" Keep your mind fresh with news that sparks your interest and gives you the inspiration you need to keep striving for the goals you have set for yourself.",1,scorpio,2018
28,"Pressures to get unfinished tasks completed and new ones begun cause emotions to run high. Everyone, yourself included, is likely to feel nervous and stressed out, and quarrels may break out. It might be best if you keep your eyes and mind focused on the tasks at hand and not on the petty squabbles that are going on around you, Scorpio. This keeps your blood pressure down and reassures those you want to impress.",1,scorpio,2018
29,"If you find yourself needing to do something in order to escape your life for a while, Scorpio, then maybe you need to examine your life more closely. Instead of trying to figure out the best means of escape, try to figure out the best means for making your life more enjoyable. Make sure you're happy with yourself and the things that you're doing. If you aren't, it's time for a change.",1,scorpio,2018
30,"Today you might decide to spend much of your day alone at home, Scorpio, perhaps working on a creative project of some kind. Your intellect and imagination are operating at a high level, and a gathering of friends might have brought inspiration your way. This is actually a good day to make use of your artistic talent. Your insight and vision should give rise to some moving results. Work hard!",1,scorpio,2018
31,"Today you could decide to attend a class, workshop, or social event involving people in a spiritual, metaphysical, or intellectual field. Fascinating discussions could lead to insights and revelations of your own, Scorpio. You could explore ways to harness your natural healing ability, perhaps through Reiki, massage, or other hands-on disciplines. Expect to spend the next few days being preoccupied with ideas you learn today. They should have a profound impact.",1,scorpio,2018
1,"Be careful about getting caught up with people who are careless or fickle, Scorpio, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Your tender emotions are too sensitive to endure the thoughtlessness, bluntness, and ultimately the rejection of someone who simply wasn’t a good person for you to hang around with in the first place. Try not to invest yourself emotionally in situations or people today.",2,scorpio,2018
2,"Your emotional nature may seem revved up for action today, Scorpio, although it could be that you don't know what direction to drive in. The engine is running, but for some reason the windshield looks a bit cloudy. Try to key into the areas in your life that need a major overhaul. Look to transform them for the better. Once your windshield is clear, kick your motor into gear and go for it. Initiate the action or else you may find yourself being acted upon.",2,scorpio,2018
3,"A close friend or your love partner may present you with a gift, Scorpio. You'll be touched but you'll also feel uncomfortable. Maybe the present is costly or not something you really like. You might also feel that your friend is too eager. What you do in this situation is, of course, up to you. Tip: don't refuse the gift unless you genuinely feel it’s totally inappropriate. And definitely don't give it back because that's what your mother would do!",2,scorpio,2018
4,"Getting through today shouldn't pose too big a problem for you, Scorpio. You may feel a huge second wind that can give you the drive and determination to see your chores and projects through. Make some plans for this evening, such as getting together with friends or taking in an event that really intrigues you. Until then, go about your tasks bit by bit. You'll get things finished before you know it.",2,scorpio,2018
5,"Put your ambition into action today, Scorpio. The day's planetary aspects should find you feeling energetic and positive. Make the most of this by taking steps toward your goals. As you know, if you don't actively pursue things, nothing will happen. The years can pass by so quickly and you wouldn't want to be sitting on a rocker wondering “what if.” Trust yourself and do what it takes. Everything starts with a single step.",2,scorpio,2018
6,"You might feel the need for some time to yourself today, Scorpio. And why not take it? Chances are you’re surrounded by others most of the time, and when you don't take time to be alone with your thoughts and feelings, it can prove unhealthy for you. Taking care of your emotional well-being is critical, as you have a deeply sensitive nature. With continuous activity around you, there's no time to connect with this part of you. Make time today.",2,scorpio,2018
7,"Scorpio, put some music on to get yourself going today, especially if you feel a little lonely. Music often has as strong an effect as conversation. This is because it provides an avenue for you to communicate with a deeper part of yourself. Your sensitive nature can find comfort and hope through harmonies and rhythms like nothing else. Pull out your favorites and listen, sing along, or even dance. Enjoy your day to the fullest!",2,scorpio,2018
8,"Focus on yourself today, Scorpio. Yours is often an extremely giving nature. You can be compassionate to a fault, in that too much of your energy goes to helping solve others’ problems. Then you're left without enough focus for yourself and the things that are troubling you. See about spending some time alone to concentrate on any issues you have. Reach out to a trusted friend for guidance and support. Allow someone to nurture you for a change.",2,scorpio,2018
9,"It's a super day to make decisions, Scorpio. You can sit on the fence for a little too long when it comes to serious choices. Seize the energy that flows from today's planetary aspects, make a list of things that need to be decided in the areas of work, relationships, and finances, and go down the list one by one. Don't be afraid of making a mistake. Better that than missing out entirely, don't you think?",2,scorpio,2018
10,"Expect a strong boost to your ego and self-confidence today, Scorpio. Your physical and mental energies are very high, and you're apt to feel that you're capable of moving mountains. Take advantage of this new motivation while you can, since today you could make definite progress on any goal toward which you may be striving. The support and encouragement of friends and colleagues should prove invaluable. Go for the gold!",2,scorpio,2018
11,"A number of people in interesting fields, such as law, education, or writing and publishing, could cross your path today, Scorpio. This could involve your job, or perhaps these people attend a social event that you host in your home. Either way, some fascinating and useful information could come your way that alters your thinking and nudges it subtly in a new direction. You'll want to make the most of it. Have fun!",2,scorpio,2018
12,"Visitors might come to your home today to discuss business of some kind, Scorpio, perhaps job related, perhaps about an enterprise you're developing on your own. If you aren't careful, however, you could get caught up in conversations that are more social than practical and thus lose sight of the reasons you got together. Stay focused on the matter at hand and you could be pleasantly surprised at the results.",2,scorpio,2018
13,"Some days it may be hard for you to get motivated, Scorpio, but if ever there were a day in which it was easier than others, this would be the day. You’ll find that your mind is quite attuned to the situation around you and that your sense of grounding is helping you manifest that which you wish to bring to life. There’s a sense of time restriction and limitation to the day that is prodding you to act now.",2,scorpio,2018
14,"Today you might be trying to learn about a new form of modern technology, perhaps computer related, Scorpio, and you could find it too confusing for words. Your brain could be going into overload, so it's probably best to take it one step at a time! It's also important to remember to take breaks and clear your head. Too much information all at once could result in your not being able to absorb any of it.",2,scorpio,2018
15,"Some paperwork involving business enterprises could be executed today, Scorpio, possibly in your home. This might be a new and unexpected development. It could have you feeling a bit disoriented, but try to pull yourself together and make the most of it. Whatever the opportunity, all signs say that it might prove quite successful, so don't let it pass you by. Go with the flow and see where it takes you. You could be pleasantly surprised!",2,scorpio,2018
16,"You’re very intuitive by nature, Scorpio, and today you should be feeling especially so. Don't be surprised if you spontaneously tune in to the ideas and emotions of those around you, or even if you and someone else come up with the same words at the same time. Use your insights to increase your understanding of others. You might also find that they bring artistic inspiration and even advance your worldly ambitions.",2,scorpio,2018
17,"Obligations to others could incline you toward staying home today, Scorpio, but important career issues could pull you in to work. This could cause some inner conflict, and you may have to face a choice. Only you can make that choice, but take care to be objective and take all the facts into consideration. Don't get yourself all emotionally worked up. This will only exacerbate the situation.",2,scorpio,2018
18,"You’re normally a very intuitive person, and today you may experience clairvoyance that could rival Jeane Dixon’s. You could be feeling especially attuned to other planes, and your dreams are likely to be powerful and vivid. Use the messages you receive to inspire creative pursuits. Try your hand at painting, music, or poetry. You might not only be amazed by the results but learn even more from the work itself.",2,scorpio,2018
19,"You may have a wonderful day today, Scorpio. Your imagination, intuition, and creativity are all high, and inspiration for new artistic works could be filling your heart and brain. You'll be all too happy to discuss your ideas with anyone who shows an interest. The one dark spot in the day might be that a child, close friend, or lover goes into a snit because he or she feels ignored. Don't worry. They’ll come out of it.",2,scorpio,2018
20,"Your self-confidence could well be in the pits today, Scorpio. Mistakes from the past could come back to haunt you, and you may be momentarily overcome by the fear that you'll make similar errors again. Force yourself to be objective before you drive yourself crazy. It could cause you some unnecessary problems. Try to realize that you’re unique and that you have skills and talents that set you apart from everyone.",2,scorpio,2018
21,"An older relative or neighbor may need your assistance today, Scorpio. This is apt to be a very inconvenient time for someone to ask for help, because you have plenty of chores of your own. Nonetheless, you'll go to the rescue because that's your nature. Take care to plan your time carefully, pace yourself, and try not to do too much at once. That way you'll live to help again tomorrow.",2,scorpio,2018
22,"A pleasant outing could get delayed or cancelled due to an event entirely out of your control. Rather than having a fit, Scorpio, you and your friends could seize the opportunity to do something completely wild and different. For example, you could take in a matinee of the scariest movie in town or finally try out that Ethiopian restaurant you've been hearing so much about. Today brings a perfect opportunity to make lemonade out of lemons.",2,scorpio,2018
23,"A change of profession may be in the stars for you, Scorpio, or a change of hobby at the very least. The latest technological advances have really captured your interest. Making films, in particular, gets your creative juices flowing. Perhaps it's time to sign up for a weekend workshop or splurge on that video camera you've been eyeing. The diversion will do you a world of good.",2,scorpio,2018
24,"A friend or relative might propose some travel, Scorpio, but today you don't even want to think about going to the grocery store. You won't feel much like talking to anyone, either. Your mind is probably on intellectual or metaphysical matters. You could just want to stay home and study those subjects all day. Tell your friend the idea of traveling sounds great and you'll discuss it later. That's all you can manage right now.",2,scorpio,2018
25,"You’re bubbling over with confidence and enthusiasm, Scorpio. Not surprisingly, those around you respond in kind. Your smile is contagious, and you have people joking and laughing with you throughout the day. You’ll have much success in whatever you do today, although group efforts will likely prove more rewarding. Romance figures prominently in the evening, so make the most of it!",2,scorpio,2018
26,"Certainly there are advantages and disadvantages to the high level of intuition you have. Today you may feel weighed down by some strange thoughts that enter your head. Only time will tell if they are true premonitions or simply weird daydreams. In the meantime, you’d probably be best served by ignoring them completely. Life is too short to play the ""what if"" game.",2,scorpio,2018
27,"Your career may be sidetracked by petty gossip, rumor, and office politics. It's likely that someone is pushing forward his or her agenda without any thought or concern for its impact on others. Do what you can to put a stop to such shenanigans, Scorpio. There are times when it's appropriate to be the whistleblower, and this is one of them.",2,scorpio,2018
28,"A new creative project of some kind, perhaps involving modern technology, could set your career in a new direction, Scorpio. This may be the break you've been hoping for, and you're apt to be very excited about it. Any new enterprise begun today is going to have its ups and downs, but all signs indicate that it will succeed. Consider the project carefully before making a decision. Then if it feels right, go for it!",2,scorpio,2018
1,"Money and friendship rarely mix, Scorpio. Keep this in mind today if a friend hits you up for a loan. You'd be better off helping her strategize ways to earn more money. Much as you like to help the underdog, a temporary approach often does more harm than good. A quick loan won't help your friend's fundamental problem of compulsive spending. Offering to pay for counseling would be a gift of enduring value.",3,scorpio,2018
2,"Your concentration should be high today, Scorpio. You're likely to be more observant than usual. Don't be surprised if you find yourself noticing people and sensing their thoughts and feelings even more than usual. This is a good day to read, study, attend a class, or otherwise acquire new information. You may discover something new about a subject that really interests you, and you might want to spend the day reading about it.",3,scorpio,2018
3,"Today is a day to roll with the punches, Scorpio. Don't take anything too seriously, and refrain from making any major decisions. You might get the sense that something or someone is working behind the scenes without your knowledge. Trust your instincts. See what you can do to bridge the gap between reality and what you sense from the spiritual world. Visit the ocean or take a long walk in the woods.",3,scorpio,2018
4,"Attempts to master a new computer program or other form of high-tech equipment could seem to be going nowhere, Scorpio. You might tend to doubt your ability and thus feel very frustrated. However, keep at it. You aren't beyond all help! Nothing more than a little focus, concentration, and dogged persistence is required. It might also pay to ask someone's help who knows more about it.",3,scorpio,2018
5,"Today, Scorpio, a subject that particularly interests you could cause you to delve into obscure sources to shed more light on it. Your intuition should help, but today you're more inclined to search for solid evidence. You might find what you seek in an unusual place and in an unconventional way. You might want to carry a notebook and pen with you today, even if it's just to the corner store!",3,scorpio,2018
6,"Enjoying the good times may be fun, but it may also get you into trouble down the road, Scorpio. Be careful of spending all your resources on pleasure without setting something aside for leaner times. The company you keep could encourage your self-destructive behaviors. Since they know you'll always be in for a good time, you could get swept away by the energy of the crowd. Better to stick close to those who support healthier habits.",3,scorpio,2018
7,"Things should flow well for you today with very little effort on your part, Scorpio. Take note that if any quarrel arises, it's an indication that the person you're arguing with isn't necessarily the right person to deal with or confide in. Emotional issues are likely to be the hardest ones to overcome, but this shouldn't be a problem for you. You have the ability to work through these like a pro.",3,scorpio,2018
8,"Remember that even though there is tension and chaos all around, Scorpio, it doesn't have to affect you. Your motto should be you're ""in it but not of it."" The basis of most feuds boils down to the struggle between the old and the new. Try not to let their battles become yours. Learn from them by staying close enough to observe and understand but far enough away that you keep your hands clean.",3,scorpio,2018
9,"You're a born romantic by nature, Scorpio, but today you're likely to think more in terms of physical passion than idealized romance. You're likely to be especially concerned with your appearance, and might want to go for a professional makeover or buy some new clothes. The color blue might seem especially appealing right now, but don't forget to add some red for passion! Phone your romantic interest and have fun tonight!",3,scorpio,2018
10,"Live your creative fantasies today, Scorpio, but watch out for the reality police at the border. You may experience a bit of conflict with a stubborn person or in a situation that isn't very well planned. Think things through before taking action or else you may be lost in a world of daydreams without any escape route. Set your mind on the positive aspects of the situation and you'll succeed.",3,scorpio,2018
11,"There is a burning restlessness inside you that is activated because you don't feel as if you're fulfilling your life's destiny, Scorpio. You could have a sudden insight that you have a much greater purpose in this life than what you're doing now. Explore this idea and see how you can move toward this desire that comes from deep within. This is the perfect time to put large, long-term plans into action.",3,scorpio,2018
12,"Anger is apt to stir inside you today, Scorpio, so beware of any actions that might manifest as a result of this powerful feeling. Do what you can to find the deep source of this anger. If it's an obvious injustice, see the situation as an opportunity for change, and work to reform the policy that led to this breach of fairness and equality.",3,scorpio,2018
13,"Don't be a pushover today, Scorpio. This is your time to lead. At least get your opinion out in the open and let it be known to the people around you. Put some passion in your day in order to liven things up and get the energy moving. A powerful transformation may take place within you as you start to wield your power instead of give it blindly away to others.",3,scorpio,2018
14,"Your faithful and diligent work, Scorpio, in addition to a lot of sacrifices for the sake of your career, will soon bear fruit. The anticipation of a great evaluation, with possible advancement, is likely to have you walking on air all day, full of dreams and plans for the future. Enjoy this well-deserved peace of mind. Spend some time today enjoying your family. Perhaps you could plan a pre-celebration.",3,scorpio,2018
15,"You know that you have a very fertile imagination, Scorpio, and today's aspects highlight this special quality. You might wish to channel your thoughts into an artistic endeavor like writing or painting. Be sure to grab any opportunity to weave a fascinating tale for a child. Be careful about letting your imagination run away with you when making judgments about people. They're most likely on the up and up.",3,scorpio,2018
16,"Strain within a group that you're associated with could be traced to money problems. Perhaps people are disagreeing over what needs to be done regarding fundraising or budgetary limitations. It's best to divorce yourself from this sort of thing if possible, Scorpio. It's draining. Strange, vivid dreams might haunt your sleep tonight, but don't read too much into them. They aren't the kind with any special significance.",3,scorpio,2018
17,"Make the effort to get to a body of water today, Scorpio. Whether it's the ocean, a river, or lake, the sense of expansion and comfort that you'll find there will be extremely healing. Know that you are the greatest healer you have for yourself and that you have incredible power to share this gift with others, too. Augment this healing energy with a return to nature.",3,scorpio,2018
18,"The completion of a long-term goal might have you feeling enthusiastic, energetic, and happy. You're also likely to be looking to the future, Scorpio, formulating ideas for other projects and discussing them with friends. Group activities could benefit you at this time and put you in touch with new people who could possibly become close to you. In the evening, go to an exciting movie. A thriller would suit you just fine.",3,scorpio,2018
19,"Feel free to enlist your own creativity today to solve any problem that may come your way, Scorpio. Don't feel like you absolutely need to take a rational and methodical approach. This sort of frame of mind has already been tried. Now it's time to explore a more intuitive way to complete any task that you wish to tackle now. Exercise more of your sensitive nature.",3,scorpio,2018
20,"Someone who lives far away, someone you haven't heard from for a long time, could give you a surprise phone call today. You'll be delighted and probably stay on the phone too long. You might need to run a few errands, but the weather could keep you indoors. Don't worry about it, Scorpio. You'll still have time to take care of other pressing matters. You should be feeling especially artistic right now. Be creative!",3,scorpio,2018
21,"Today you could be faced with a bunch of people from out of town that you've never met before. You're likely to find this exciting and stimulating, but you could also feel a bit flustered. You might also not be at your most outgoing right now. This could be a better day to listen than to try to talk. Sometimes that impresses people more than anything you might say, Scorpio.",3,scorpio,2018
22,"Today you might experience, however briefly, the most intense and refined type of spiritual love, Scorpio. Perhaps this is for a friend, child, lover, or maybe for all life forms on the planet. You're also feeling especially artistic, so if you've been planning to make something as a gift, this is the time to do it. All signs bode well for other artistic projects as well. Go to it, and enjoy your day.",3,scorpio,2018
23,"You may have plans to get together with friends, and you're probably looking forward to it. However, Scorpio, delays could get in the way, although you aren't likely to let them stop you. Your concentration and perseverance are both higher than usual, so it isn't likely that you'll give up on anything you start today. Therefore, this is a good day to either begin or continue projects that mean a lot to you.",3,scorpio,2018
24,"A young colleague could leave your place of employment under strange circumstances, Scorpio, and this could come as a shock to you. You may have been quite fond of this person, and find yourself wondering about the truth behind the departure. Gossip may buzz, but don't pay any attention to it. Chances are it's a health problem, but no one, including your colleague, feels comfortable discussing it.",3,scorpio,2018
25,"Short trips in your neighborhood may be rendered nearly impossible today by factors above and beyond your control, such as traffic, construction, or both, Scorpio. If you have errands to run, put them off. If you can, walk or ride a bicycle. If you must go in the car, however, make sure you have your favorite music with you so you can do something while waiting in traffic. Otherwise, you'll go crazy with boredom.",3,scorpio,2018
26,"Professional interests are definitely served by your intuition and fertile imagination today, Scorpio. Writing, speaking, or the dramatic arts could be involved. If your career involves communication in any form, expect to capture the interest of a lot of people now. Positive career changes are in the wind, although they may not be apparent to you just yet. This isn't the time to worry about the future. For now, let your imagination guide you.",3,scorpio,2018
27,"You may feel at odds with the rest of the world now, Scorpio, as you yearn for some quiet time alone. See if you can find a balance between spending time with your family and time alone. If you set the alarm to wake you early, you can enjoy the peace and quiet of dawn. If you aren't an early riser, you can always sequester yourself in the library for a few hours of solitude.",3,scorpio,2018
28,"If you're single and looking for love, Scorpio, you may find it today in an ephemeral way. You could find yourself falling hard for the proverbial stranger across the crowded room. That might pose a problem if the room is actually a crowded subway, but faith is called for here. If the person appears to share your attraction, you'll manage to find each other. You have a lot to look forward to. Enjoy your day.",3,scorpio,2018
29,"As a person who enjoys being gregarious and outgoing, days like this provide a wonderful outlet for your energy. You might spend a lot of time with your family today, Scorpio, but you'll also probably touch base with many others. At some point you might find yourself in the spotlight. You'll feel especially fond of everyone around you and appreciate your good fortune. Enjoy your day.",3,scorpio,2018
30,"Something wonderful could happen to you today at home, Scorpio. A lover could declare eternal devotion, spiritual revelations could come thick and fast, or great news regarding career or money matters could be just over the horizon. Whatever comes is apt to bring happiness for all concerned. You may pinch yourself to make sure you're awake! Relax and enjoy it. You have it coming, and it's there to be savored.",3,scorpio,2018
31,"Financial worries could plague you today, Scorpio. This is unfortunate, because your concerns are probably misplaced. There may be a few adjustments to make, but nothing a little belt-tightening for a few days can't fix. Find something inexpensive but fascinating to do like reading or watching a documentary. You'll forget your troubles and learn something in the meantime. Once you get past it, you should see it in proper perspective. Relax!",3,scorpio,2018
1,"Business might be going very well for you, Scorpio, but intense changes on the job could have you feeling stressed. Delays in starting new projects could prove frustrating. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that this is going to be a trend. All should be brought back into focus tomorrow. Go to the gym tonight and work off some frustration. You'll be fresh in the morning. Hang in there!",4,scorpio,2018
2,"Today could be filled with unexpected twists, turns, and bends in the road that you may not be prepared for, Scorpio. Apparently someone forgot to install the sign that warns of sharp curves ahead. Be on the lookout for unexpected forks in the road. When you get to them, take them, to coin a phrase. Your brain could receive a jolt from an outside source that reminds you to keep things real.",4,scorpio,2018
3,"You're likely to be feeling a bit lonely, perhaps even isolated, Scorpio. Maybe you think no one else has your same wild thoughts running through their heads. You'd be surprised to learn how many people do. It's unlikely, however, that you'll share these thoughts with anyone, especially now. Don't feel like you have to. Just know that you aren't alone and that you have a network of support at all times.",4,scorpio,2018
4,"Aggression in your world of romance is likely, Scorpio. Whether coming from you or your close partner, the tension is there and can't be ignored. Keep in mind, however, that it's possible that much of it stems from something that isn't even true. Perhaps there was a misspoken word or misunderstanding of some sort that's now causing confusion. Do your best to clear the air of any misconceptions.",4,scorpio,2018
5,"There is some likelihood of a slight career conflict, Scorpio. You might have to deal with a co-worker who steps on your toes or runs roughshod over your gentle nature. Defend yourself with your favorite weapons - silence, laughter, and perspective. Let your adversary tangle himself or herself in desperate attempts to justify their behavior. Let your boss be the wise and discerning judge of the matter.",4,scorpio,2018
6,"More than ever before, you'll feel as though it's time to take matters into your own hands and build your own career future. You're fed up with living on hope and putting off your happiness until tomorrow. Your determination will be so strong that you could even surprise yourself. Tomorrow you'll refine your approach and make it more concrete. Today is the first day of a new life for you, Scorpio.",4,scorpio,2018
7,"You tend to be very intuitive, Scorpio, but today you could find your psychic abilities short-circuit. If you give readings, don't schedule any for today. This isn't to say your abilities are blocked, but they aren't as dependable as they usually are. Likewise, your imagination isn't as reliable either. Don't worry. This is just typical writer's or artist's block. You'll be back to normal by tomorrow.",4,scorpio,2018
8,"Some big upheaval in your career could take you by surprise, Scorpio, but it's apt to make a very positive difference to you. Your public standing and income could both skyrocket. Legal papers might be involved in some way. This could happen so suddenly that it has you in a daze, but try to remain focused and go with the flow. You won't want this opportunity to pass you by.",4,scorpio,2018
9,"Your desire to see a romantic partner could be very strong today, Scorpio. However, if you ask, you might be turned down. Don't jump to the conclusion that your friend doesn't want to see you. If he or she says there are responsibilities to attend to, believe it! You might have to wait until another day, but that's probably the worst that will happen. Have a little faith and hang in there!",4,scorpio,2018
10,"Scorpio, you're likely to want to retreat into your bedroom and slam the door today. You won't feel like talking or socializing with anyone, not even those closest to you. Too much work could have you in a state of near exhaustion and almost total burnout, which means that getting some rest is probably the best thing you could do right now. Relax now, and get yourself going again tomorrow.",4,scorpio,2018
11,"A phone call or email from a friend could open up new career possibilities for you, Scorpio, perhaps involving the communications industry. Tales of people who have hit it big in this field could be circulating widely, but you should carefully consider all the aspects of any new option before jumping in. You don't want to have any regrets about your decision later. Think about it!",4,scorpio,2018
12,"Are you contemplating a move of some kind, Scorpio? Perhaps you're thinking about relocating to be closer to members of a group with which you're affiliated. You might also be considering a move to a community where spiritual and metaphysical values are not only discussed but also lived. Make a list of your options, if that helps. You're in a transitional period right now. You need to be practical.",4,scorpio,2018
13,"Today's planetary aspects indicate that this is likely to be a day of excess, Scorpio, some of it good, some of it not so good. Take care not to overindulge in food and drink. You could be merely acting out your stress with such behavior. You'd be better served to meditate and get to the root of the problem. On the other hand, money could come your way, possibly a lot of it!",4,scorpio,2018
14,"An intense study of philosophy, religion, or some other exalted school of thought could find you involved with a group that shares your interest in the subject. You could make a new friend today, or if you aren't currently romantically involved, meet a potential romantic partner. This should be a very satisfying day on both mental and emotional levels. Remember how it all came about, and enjoy yourself!",4,scorpio,2018
15,"Today could have you itching for a change, Scorpio. The difficulty is figuring out what you really want to do with your life. A good first step would be to talk to people. Find out what they do and don't like about their careers. Use the library and the Internet. Take a profile test, such as Myers-Briggs, to see what types of careers mesh with your personality. Once you've done this, you're bound to have a clearer vision of where you want to go.",4,scorpio,2018
16,"You'll want to respond to your creative juices, which will be flowing freely today, Scorpio. Don't suppress the urge to sing, compose, paint, or write. You'll be in the full flower of creativity, so make the most of it. You'll be able to take care of your daily obligations and still make room for your creative expression. Listen to the messages you receive in your heart and let them burst forth.",4,scorpio,2018
17,"This could be a rather intense day for you, Scorpio. Your mind is filled with plots for novels you want to write and ideas for ways to streamline production at work. Don't you have an ""pause"" switch? You'd benefit from taking some much-needed time off. You'll find that you can quiet your mind simply by sipping some tea and being still for ten minutes. Call it meditation or a break, but allow yourself this small indulgence.",4,scorpio,2018
18,"This is bound to be a wonderful day, Scorpio, as everybody seems to be in a warm and congenial mood. You and your romantic partner, in particular, are feeling especially close and connected today. If marriage is the process of falling in and out of love, then you're both definitely in the ""in"" phase. Enjoy it while it lasts! Spend a quiet day together and cap it off with dinner at an elegant bistro.",4,scorpio,2018
19,"This is going to be a rather busy day for you, Scorpio, and you're likely to love every minute of it. You can expect to meet many people as you go about your day. There will be side trips and detours that you weren't anticipating, but they're all the more delightful because of their spontaneity, like the unexpected lunch with a friend. Such stolen moments enrich your life.",4,scorpio,2018
20,"Making decisions today is apt to be nearly impossible for you, Scorpio. That's why you should leave them up to someone else. Walk with your partner so you don't have to really think about where you're going. Your job is to focus on the emotional side of things and make it safe for everyone to dream. Your loving, caring nature is a valuable commodity these days. Protect and cherish this gift.",4,scorpio,2018
21,"Your natural psychic or intuitive abilities could be short-circuited today, Scorpio. Interference from the minds of other people could cloud issues, and this won't do you any good. Your imaginative faculties could be rather garbled as well. The best possible advice would be to take the day for your own needs. You can go back to your usual routine tomorrow.",4,scorpio,2018
22,"If you play your cards right, Scorpio, you just might be able to turn what you're picking up psychically into an exalted creative effort. The emotions and images flowing into your brain might be obscure, but they're significant in some way. Whether you write, play music, dance, or paint, you could be blown away by your own work. Whatever your materials, get them out and memorialize your inspiration. Tomorrow you'll be glad you did!",4,scorpio,2018
23,"Someone at your workplace could suddenly find you very attractive and make no secret of it today, Scorpio. How you respond, of course, is up to you, but if you don't reciprocate this person's feelings, don't respond positively simply because you're flattered. This could cause trouble for you down the line, particularly if this person is in a position of authority. Hold out for the right person!",4,scorpio,2018
24,"You feel invincible, Scorpio, as though you can do anything. Enjoy this abundance of energy, for it's certainly unusual. Take care not to overdo it. If you haven't jogged in a while, running five miles today will leave you pretty sore tomorrow. Similarly, don't try to finish all your household repairs in one day. Remember that slow and easy wins the race and keeps you in shape for the long haul!",4,scorpio,2018
25,"If you feel like you're trying to push a square peg into a round hole, you're probably right, Scorpio. Whether you're having personal or professional difficulties, there are times when it just doesn't pay to try so hard. In fact, it's often a sign that there is something fundamentally wrong with the relationship. Try to take more of a philosophical attitude, Scorpio. If it's meant to work, it will.",4,scorpio,2018
26,"If you often help people in need, or if helping people is part of your profession, this day will bring certain ideas to light, Scorpio. You need to take the time on a regular basis to take care of yourself. If you don't, you won't be able to continue to help others. Think about it and stop making excuses for why you can't do it. Think of yourself for a change.",4,scorpio,2018
27,"Today is full of possibilities, Scorpio. You could fall in love at first sight, or at least meet someone who captures your interest! You should be feeling especially loving, passionate, and eager to devote yourself to a worthy cause or creative activity. Don't expect everything to fall into place right away. You could hit a few obstacles, but the ultimate result will be worth the bumps along the way.",4,scorpio,2018
28,"Today doubts may crop up for you concerning certain spiritual concepts that you've embraced for a long time, Scorpio. Don't let this cause a crisis. It could just be a normal part of your inner growth. Instead, go back and read the old books that got you started, and then read some new ones and try to view the ideas from your current perspective. You could find they aren't so doubtful after all.",4,scorpio,2018
29,"A female visitor could come to your door today with some interesting, useful information, Scorpio. It might involve anything from stock market trends to a forthcoming wedding to occult and metaphysical matters. Whatever it is, you'll find it captivating, and might just sit and listen to your guest for quite a while. By the time she leaves, your mind may well be spinning. Take a walk to clear your head or you'll be awake all night.",4,scorpio,2018
30,"Today you might read a book on exercise or nutrition that seems a bit unsettling, Scorpio. According to the book, you're doing everything wrong! Remember that what the author is probably outlining is a certain practice that worked for him or her. Everyone is different. Don't change your habits for practices that don't feel right. Consult a professional if you're still concerned. Such a person is more than capable of discerning what's right for you.",4,scorpio,2018
1,"Although you might find the day ahead somewhat stressful, it's a key day in your professional evolution. Since you've lacked inspiration lately, you must not miss the opportunity you'll be presented with today. You could find out about an internship in a new field, which may lead to a new passion or commitment. Expect to see a new wish for the future forming within you, Scorpio!",5,scorpio,2018
2,"Today is no time for dreaming, Scorpio! Quite the contrary. You can expect to have to settle a number of minor technical problems involving communications or transmissions. On the whole, it will be a somewhat trying day, but at least your mind will be occupied, leaving no room for the difficult internal questions that have been bothering you so much lately.",5,scorpio,2018
3,"Perhaps you're stuck in a mindset you can't seem to escape, Scorpio. Be careful about taking action based on ideas rooted more in past fantasy than present reality. Your emotions could be playing tricks on you. You could be attached to a dream that has more to do with feeding your ego than fulfilling your destiny. Question your motives. You might find that you're better off redirecting your energy somewhere else.",5,scorpio,2018
4,"Your natural compassion may have led you to choose a profession in which healing or helping other people is your primary duty. Even if this isn't the case, Scorpio, the people around you may seem particularly demanding today. But be careful not to go beyond your personal limits or else you could be the one who needs other people's help!",5,scorpio,2018
5,"Some rather depressing information could come your way, Scorpio, but don't take it at face value. It might not be as bad as it seems. Check the facts before making yourself crazy. This isn't a good day for visiting or running errands in your neighborhood, as the traffic could be a nightmare. Anything you try to read today could seem boring, so movies are likely to be the best entertainment now.",5,scorpio,2018
6,"Spiritual and intellectual matters may be very much on your mind, Scorpio. A lot of ideas could have come your way, although until now they may not have been very focused. Today, however, your mind should be clear enough to write down your thoughts and read the works of others in order to gain more insight. The possibility of a short trip out of town could also arise. Enjoy your day.",5,scorpio,2018
7,"Your indecisiveness may plague you, Scorpio. This is one of those times when you feel as if one second of hesitation will cost you dearly. Yet you take a while to process and internalize things before you're ready to act on them. Others may act and speak before they think. Don't get upset at yourself for handling things the way you do. More than anything, it's your lack of self-confidence that's holding you back.",5,scorpio,2018
8,"Do what you can to stabilize your emotions, Scorpio. Romance should be on a slow, steady path as long as you're honest with yourself and others about how you feel. Perhaps you're so caught up in your fantasy world that you fail to see that things are actually moving in your favor. Conflict that arises today may be uncomfortable, but ultimately it will shed more light on the truth of the situation.",5,scorpio,2018
9,"Today will be fairly calm in terms of outside events, but your inner world is likely to be in a rush of activity. Today you wish you could find the solution to your heartaches as well as your career predicaments. You'd like to achieve some supreme understanding of the events that took place over the past month. First you must force your brain to slow down. Haste makes waste, as you know!",5,scorpio,2018
10,"Until now, you didn't know you were capable of managing people with problems. But the so-called poetic universe you inhabit is actually much more realistic than it seems at first glance. People who believe that human reality is 100 percent logical will feel ridiculous when they see the elegant, humane solutions you invent.",5,scorpio,2018
11,"Your stroll through the universe of possibilities that you so love has come to an end, Scorpio. It's time for you to come back to Earth and join the rest of us. You have more hope than most people, like the good Scorpio that you are. You understand that we need your imagination and courage regarding the future! Today you may have to make an important professional decision.",5,scorpio,2018
12,"You can expect today to be kind of intense, Scorpio. Even if you've made a conscious decision not to let anything get you down, you may still harbor some negative emotions from the last few days. Take advantage of this time to relieve stress. Talk to someone close or go out and whack a tennis ball. An artistic pursuit, such as sketching or photography, will help eliminate some of the negative energy.",5,scorpio,2018
13,"Getting out and working with groups could seem especially appealing today, particularly groups involving athletics or other physical activities. This is an excellent day to go out for team sports or attend a yoga, aerobics, or tai chi class. You could also want to make a short trip out of town with some friends. A bit of adventure is definitely in the wind for you, Scorpio. Enjoy it!",5,scorpio,2018
14,"Feeling unusually adventurous, Scorpio? You're often motivated by your idealistic expectations, and the planetary configurations today are going to push you even further on your spiritual quest. Satisfy your desire to discover new horizons and meet new people by saying hello to anyone and everyone you feel like talking to. Sometimes life's biggest adventures begin with a simple action.",5,scorpio,2018
15,"Today's aspects are suggesting that you take a good hard look at the state of your ego, Scorpio. Are you too proud or too humble? Buddhists say that the path to spiritual fulfillment lies in knowing how to build a healthy ego while at the same time developing a part of oneself completely foreign to the ego. Are you working hard at this?",5,scorpio,2018
16,"More than ever before, you'll feel as though it's time to take matters into your own hands and build your future, Scorpio. You're fed up with living on hope and putting your happiness off until tomorrow. Your determination will be so strong that you may even surprise yourself. You'll refine your approach and make it more concrete in the coming days. Today is the first day of a new life for you.",5,scorpio,2018
17,"This is an excellent day for you, Scorpio. You should find that things are running smoothly and to your advantage. Watch out for those who may want to rain on your parade by bombarding you with information that doesn't really connect with the way you feel. This information is unrelated to the real issues - how you feel and why. Pay attention to your heart.",5,scorpio,2018
18,"You can interpret the day ahead as an open-ended question about you, Scorpio. You may have noticed certain physical or psychological aspects of yourself that make you uncomfortable. The day ahead may force you to take action to correct that attitude. If you just share your concerns with a friend or relative, you'll accomplish a great deal.",5,scorpio,2018
19,"Was someone close to you rude without any provocation? Were you the target of unpleasant criticism? You take these slights to heart. Beginning today, and throughout the days to come, you can expect to withdraw somewhat in order to lick your wounds. You need more harmony and gentleness in your love life, and you're likely to obtain that soon. Be patient!",5,scorpio,2018
20,"Decisions will be even more difficult to make than usual today, Scorpio. On the one hand, you may feel a need to stabilize, while on the other hand find that your energy is raging in a million different directions as you want to seek new experiences and social interactions with others. Try to adopt a plan that combines both of these energies. Nervous energy will keep you moving.",5,scorpio,2018
21,"Consciously, realize that you're someone unique and special, Scorpio. Remember this through the day and let your actions reflect this affirmation. There's a rather distinct intensity to the day that might cause others to be on edge. Don't be disrupted if there are people freaking out in your world. The good news is that you should be able to handle this intense blast of emotion easily. Emotions are your forte!",5,scorpio,2018
22,"There's an excellent day on the horizon, Scorpio. If you feel hemmed in by fears or uncertainties in your love life, the day ahead will give you the courage to discuss these matters with your mate. Even if more time is necessary to settle things completely, you should make good use of today's clear communication channels. You won't be disappointed (and neither will your mate).",5,scorpio,2018
23,"Other people might have a hard time navigating through the day, thanks to the intensity and corruption that's likely to surface. You have nothing to worry about, Scorpio, because your adaptable nature is perfectly suited to dealing with the stubborn forces that are likely to rear their heads.

24,"Take a look at what's going on around you today, Scorpio. Do some internal processing before you reach a conclusion about the best way to proceed.

Above all, enjoy yourself!",5,scorpio,2018
26,"Feel free to take the lazy route today, Scorpio. Don't lift a finger if you don't really have to. It may be hard to get others moving as well.

More than likely, you'll find that you need to adapt to the whims of others rather than the other way around.",5,scorpio,2018
27,"Shake off the dust of the past few weeks and put the confusion behind you, Scorpio. Your tremendous imagination and creative ability have been dormant lately because you may have not known how best to channel them.

You should make a conscious effort to refocus this creativity in a positive direction.",5,scorpio,2018
28,"Your intuitive nature is especially strong, Scorpio. You won't have to think about things because you'll have the ability to just know the answers.

Keep that smile on your face at all times.",5,scorpio,2018

Your imagination is operating at a high level and so is your ability to communicate with others. Go for it.",6,scorpio,2018
3,"You're normally intuitive, Scorpio, but today you might feel more psychic than you ever dreamed you could. Information received from the media could have you picking up psychically on the thoughts and feelings of people you've never met.

4,"A small financial windfall might have you in a bit of a quandary about how to spend it, Scorpio. You could have a bill you particularly want to pay, but you might also want to treat yourself to a minor luxury of some kind. The best option now might be to indulge yourself a little.

5,"Stress could take a toll on you today, Scorpio. You might temporarily lose your ambition and be left wondering if it's all really worth it.

15,"You've felt the need to create over the past several days, Scorpio. This attitude is certainly due to the planetary positions, but it could also underlie your desire to change your professional and private lives. Therefore, you should let your creative mind come out.

Bring out more of your inner self.",6,scorpio,2018

You'll be glad you did.",6,scorpio,2018
27,"Someone close to you might seem more preoccupied than usual, Scorpio, and perhaps a bit difficult to deal with. Don't take this personally. It has little if anything to do with you.

Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.",7,scorpio,2018

7,"Feel free to speak up today, Scorpio. Perhaps no one has heard your point of view in a while. It's probably important for them to hear it.

Remember that if people criticize you, it's because they love you.",7,scorpio,2018
14,"Your intuition is operating at a very high level today, Scorpio. You tend to follow your heart by nature, so you don't always go out of your way to be logical or objective.

22,"Other people are likely to be anxious to get up and moving with their plans, Scorpio. It might be better for you to hang back a bit and see how things pan out before you take action.

23,"Going with the flow may not necessarily appeal to you today, Scorpio. This is one time when you may want to be the fish swimming upstream while the school heads downstream.

6,"The possibility of impending changes in your personal or professional life could have you feeling worried and insecure. Don't be. If anything, you'll benefit from these changes.

They might mean more to you later.",11,sagittarius,2017
11,"You might walk around in a romantic, imaginative, spiritual fog with your head in the clouds. Everything may seem perfect and wonderful - perhaps too wonderful to be true.

You might take this opportunity to train in computer graphics or sound engineering.",11,sagittarius,2017
12,"You may be faced with a choice between two different realities. Friends and family are choosing sides while you remain on the fence. You're able to understand both sides of the issue, making it difficult to put your energy in only one camp. Perhaps you wish to serve as a bridge between the two camps. Things don't have to be as black and white as others see them.",11,sagittarius,2017
13,"Good news may come today. Whatever it is should make you very happy and cause you to be too hyper to sit still.

Enjoy your evening.",11,sagittarius,2017

19,"Today you might experience a rush of spiritual insights. Whatever comes to you seems clear and right, and it could inspire music, poetry, or painting.

20,"Letters and calls pertaining to your long-term goals or those of a group you're affiliated with could take up a lot of your time today.

21,"The time has come for you to take charge in matters of love and romance. This isn't often the case for you who normally like to let others take the lead in this department.

26,"You're feeling conflicting emotions today. It's possible that you enjoy your activities but feel that you aren't good enough to stick with one in particular. What you have is a confidence problem, not a competence problem. You may have an experience today that shows you just how competent and intelligent you are. Seize any opportunity presented to you!",11,sagittarius,2017
27,"Your emotions may cloud your intuition today. You might not pick up on the thoughts and feelings of others the way you normally do, and you could feel at a disadvantage.

Take the feelings into account, but don't let them dominate your decisions.",12,sagittarius,2017
3,"This is a terrific day in which you'll be able to cut through the falsehoods and get to the essence of the issue. Don't waste your time on superficial conversations and situations.

There's no need to direct it all into serious matters.",12,sagittarius,2017
9,You may be scolded for something you failed to take care of properly. There's a wonderfully expansive feeling to the day that you should capitalize on.

12,"You couldn't be in a better position in your personal life. The time is ripe to thumb your nose at your demons for the last time. Complexes, guilt, and fears of all kinds are gone. It could even be that the radical ""housecleaning"" you'll undertake will affect your professional career as you become aware of how much you've been underestimating yourself.",12,sagittarius,2017
13,"You don't have the same opinions as everyone else. Of course, this is the case for each one of us. But you seem to differ in opinion with people more and more. You may decide that it's time to design your own job, where the only boss to disagree with is you! This will carry some risks, but the potential rewards are great",12,sagittarius,2017
14,"A fairly recent goal that you've set for yourself might seem a bit overwhelming. You might wonder if you'll get it done. Though you could easily become distracted, you can focus when you try, and this is what you should do now. Finances may need attention, and possibly paperwork, but this is only routine work.",12,sagittarius,2017
15,"Equipment could give you trouble today. You're probably good at working with it, but when it comes to troubleshooting, you might not know as much as you should.

Things will get better soon.",12,sagittarius,2017
20,"You may have to take a break today from your time in the clouds. Touch down and deal with practical issues that you normally avoid.

Don't let others steer you in a direction you don't want to go.",12,sagittarius,2017
21,"Don't get overwhelmed by the intense energy of the day. Instead of cowering from it, use it as fuel to keep your internal power strong.

You can do no wrong!",12,sagittarius,2017

Don't start new projects based on anything superfluous.",12,sagittarius,2017
25,"Things may be mentally focused today, which could conflict with your emotional nature. Strong opinions may crop up, and you should take the time to listen. Don't force things to come out if they aren't ready. If the apple isn't ready to fall from the tree, don't wrench it off. Wait until the apple is ripe and the fruit will fall to you effortlessly.",12,sagittarius,2017
26,You'll have to deal with some internal and external conflict. Often you're so happy to be lost in your dreams that you don't really focus on what's going on in the real world. But today alarm bells relating either to work or finances rudely awaken you. It's useless to panic. You've learned that running away only worsens the situation.,12,sagittarius,2017
27,"You'll be in your element today. The stars challenge you to try something different. When you look at things relatively, rather than turn into a vague generalist, why not try coming up with a philosophy that's more constructive?

Write down all the information, study it, and sleep on it for a few nights before committing to anything.",12,sagittarius,2017
30,"You may find it hard to take a realistic approach to your emotions today, Sagittarius. A sensitive issue is apt to be pulling on you in such a way that it's leaving you feeling like you are way out in left field in terms of the way you relate to others. You might want to consider letting someone else take the lead for once and allow stability to form before the next decision is made.",12,sagittarius,2017
31,"After the rush of energy over the past few days, Sagittarius, today you may feel a powerful letdown. Not every day can be filled with adventure and excitement.

2,"You have so many talents and such a range of abilities, Sagittarius, that sometimes it's hard for you to know where to devote your efforts.

Concentrate on just one or two important tasks rather than mingling big jobs with small ones.",1,sagittarius,2018
3,"Anything you attempt to do today is likely to turn out really well, Sagittarius.

Figure out what your ideal job would be and then pursue it. Or better yet, create it!",1,sagittarius,2018
5,"A crisis of values may confront you today, Sagittarius. Someone you care about might need you to do something for them that you don't feel comfortable doing, and this could put you in a tough spot. You probably won't want to do it, but your friend needs your help. Consider every possible contingency before saying yes or no. Reflect on how the results could affect both you and your friend. Only in this way can you really be fair.",1,sagittarius,2018
6,"Today you might attend at least one festive social occasion, Sagittarius, and therefore you may meet some very interesting people in unusual professions, such as film or TV. Expect to hear some bizarre stories, some of them true, others that are clearly exaggerated. Out of all this friendly banter and tale telling, however, you could acquire some useful information. Make a note of it so you'll be able to remember it later.",1,sagittarius,2018
7,"You have heightened sensitivity right now, Sagittarius, and you know just how to use it. While it can be difficult to be so needed by others, right now it is your place to give help where it's needed.

In the meantime, you can feel great about all the good you're doing.",1,sagittarius,2018
8,"Money matters might require your attention today, Sagittarius. Unusual expenses may have depleted your reserves, so you might have to cut a few corners. Your income, however, is probably the same if not slightly higher. This is, therefore, only a temporary situation, and your accounts should be back to normal in time, although some caution with regard to spending may need to be observed for a while. Work creatively on your budget and try to relax.",1,sagittarius,2018
9,"Junk mail and a few telephone solicitations would almost be a welcome relief from the intense communications you've been having with people lately. All this intensity is interesting, to be sure, but also more time consuming than you'd like. You barely have time to handle your own affairs, much less those of others. If you begin to feel yourself at the bursting point, call your own personal time-out. A shower or bath would do you a world of good, Sagittarius.",1,sagittarius,2018
10,"You're probably looking pretty good, Sagittarius, but emotionally you might not feel very attractive. This could be one of those days when you look in the mirror and think you're seeing Frankenstein's monster. This is a great day to pamper yourself a little. Go for a haircut and a massage, and take a sauna or Jacuzzi while you're at it. Treat yourself to a fruit smoothie at the local juice bar. You'll feel better! Enjoy!",1,sagittarius,2018
11,"An exciting group activity, perhaps one involving a number of your friends, could take place today, Sagittarius. Your mind may be going a thousand miles an hour throughout the day. Ideas will be exchanged, stimulating conversations should take place, and you could meet some interesting new people. Someone you meet, however, has an agenda too. Be discriminating about whom you agree to meet with later.",1,sagittarius,2018
12,"Relations with those closest to you should be warm and rewarding, Sagittarius. Financial matters are going so well for you right now that you're apt to be feeling that everything will be perfect from here on out. This optimism and enthusiasm, however, doesn't mean you're taking your good fortune for granted. Rather, it is likely to give you the impetus to continue as you have been, only with more serenity than before.",1,sagittarius,2018
13,"This is not the day to do in-depth research of any kind, Sagittarius, whether it's an intellectual subject or how to put together a new computer system. Your mind is not as focused as it usually is, and it might temporarily be difficult for you to grasp new concepts that you've never encountered before. This is no reflection on your intelligence, just one of those vague days we all have. By tomorrow, all should be normal again.",1,sagittarius,2018
14,"Your mind is sharp, quick, and full of ideas, Sagittarius. Discussions with others bring useful information that could well open new doors for you if you make the most of it. Group activities should prove especially stimulating for you at this time. By the end of the day, your brain should be buzzing. Take a walk and clear your head before you go to bed or else you'll never be able to get to sleep.",1,sagittarius,2018
15,"A growing sense of intimacy with a close friend or love partner is likely to stem from mutual interests. The two of you might even discuss taking a long trip together, perhaps to a distant state or foreign country. This isn't the time to hold back or be too cautious, Sagittarius. Your life is very much on track. If you want to get away with this person, go for it. In the evening, get together with a lover!",1,sagittarius,2018
16,"Although almost everything in your life seems to be going well, Sagittarius, today you just might find yourself in a bit of a panic. You might have a temporary fit of fear that your luck won't last. However, this is most likely due to your deepest insecurities flaring up. Don't read too much into it, and don't pay any attention to the doubts expressed by others. Believe in yourself, continue to work hard, and keep moving ahead.",1,sagittarius,2018
17,"Today could be one of those days when you look around the house and think, ""What a mess!"" You might then decide to give the whole place a thorough cleaning. This is fine, Sagittarius, as long as you don't try to do it alone. Get others in the household to help out. You've been working very hard lately, and if you get too tired you could well be very short with everyone and be very poor company. Pace yourself!",1,sagittarius,2018
18,"Events both in your personal and public arenas could give you a new and unexpected sense of power over your own destiny, Sagittarius. Perhaps hard work has paid off in career and financial advancement.

If you make good use of these abilities now, this trend could continue.",1,sagittarius,2018
19,"There's no need to go pounding your head against a wall, Sagittarius, your day will be challenging, but it's nothing you can't handle.

20,"You enjoy your freedom, Sagittarius. You're a very independent person and you hate it when anything gets in your way. That's all right, but you may want to take a look at your financial situation even if that's not really your thing. You tend to resent having to deal with these lowly material questions, but if you don't, you could severely restrict your freedom to live life to its fullest. Be reasonable about things.",1,sagittarius,2018
21,"Your home today could be like Grand Central Station, with lots of people coming and going and a lot of activity taking place within the house itself. The phone could be also ringing off the hook, Sagittarius. You might wonder if your sanity will remain intact, but you'll make it through without going nuts. The problem is that there could be so much stimulation that you'll be too geared up to sleep. Take a walk before going to bed.",1,sagittarius,2018
22,"Today you should be experiencing a strong feeling of satisfaction and contentment with your life, Sagittarius. Business and financial matters continue to go well, and your home life especially appears to be secure and stable. You might be considering investing some of your resources in your home.

23,"Today, Sagittarius, you might find yourself picking up uncanny telepathic messages from a friend who lives some distance from you. A telephone call might reveal that this person has just received some good news, and that they were just thinking of calling you! This probably won't be the only ESP experience you have today. Your level of intuition is very high, so be prepared for some unusually strong psychic messages.",1,sagittarius,2018

By the time the others are done arguing and vacillating about which direction to go, you will already have traveled miles and miles down the road. Your heart wants you to take a strong, independent stance.",1,sagittarius,2018
28,"Frustrated energy resulting from inability to put your plans into action could have your nerves on edge today, Sagittarius, and you might be tempted to get into petty quarrels with those around you. Try to find alternative outlets for your energy so as to avoid this trap. There is also the danger that you might take impulsive actions without giving it any thought. Remember to stop and think before you act; otherwise, your efforts might be wasted.",1,sagittarius,2018
29,"Keep your fun-loving spirit pure, Sagittarius. Be careful that you aren't making witty conversation or entertaining jokes at someone else's expense. This type of behavior is likely to come back around and haunt you later. Keep things positive at all times, especially when you're tempted to spread information about someone that isn't exactly flattering. Today is one of those days in which you could easily slip and get your foot stuck in your mouth.",1,sagittarius,2018
30,"Expect to be surrounded by genuine love and affection today, Sagittarius. Friends, family members, and a very special romantic partner could pay you far more attention than usual. A group activity or other social event could put both you and your beloved in touch with some interesting people who could become your friends. Much information will be exchanged, including the names and phone numbers of those who might prove to be important business contacts. Have fun!",1,sagittarius,2018
31,"New information could be coming at you from all sides today, Sagittarius. Books, magazines, TV, the Internet, and conversations with friends are likely to bring exciting knowledge your way that reinforces some of your own convictions. Your intuitive abilities aren't lying fallow either. Insights and revelations could come to you that blend well with what you're learning from outside sources. Write down your thoughts. You'll want to put them to work for you later.",1,sagittarius,2018
1,"Your luck has just turned with regard to issues of love and romance, and wow! Has it turned for the better, Sagittarius! You should be sitting on cloud nine today when it comes to matters of the heart. If, for some reason, you aren’t, perhaps you should consider who is sitting next to you on that cloud. Maybe it’s time for a change. This is your day to be happy.",2,sagittarius,2018
2,"There is a tremendous amount of power at your disposal today, Sagittarius, and you should take care and use it wisely. This is quite a transformative period for you, and your body may be going through many changes. You have the ability to make an extremely strong impression on people today, so think before you act. This energy can manifest as an accident or something unhealthy if not used properly.",2,sagittarius,2018
3,"Love matters may seem to be far worse than they really are, Sagittarius. Emotion runs high as your current love interest seems preoccupied and uncommunicative; however, it wouldn't be a good idea to let your insecurities get the best of you and lash out. Your partner's heart is with you, though the mind is another matter. Family or career problems are getting in the way of your enjoyment of each other. Bite your tongue, be patient, and hang in there.",2,sagittarius,2018
4,"Working within boundaries and restrictions could really get to you today, Sagittarius. Yours is an independent spirit and your best achievements are often born of doing things your own way. Yet like it or not, we all have to follow guidelines and rules. Do your best to follow suit and finish what needs to be done. Afterward, you may find more freedom to act independently without consequences. Exercise patience and diligence as needed today.",2,sagittarius,2018
5,"Don't hesitate when it comes to taking on a project or making plans today, Sagittarius. Extra energy will complement your organizational skills, making the perfect combination to handle almost anything. Be sure to write down your goals and plans to help keep you focused. If you decide to tackle any cleaning today, get rid of the things you never use. Consider donating such items to charity, since there's undoubtedly someone out there who could use them.",2,sagittarius,2018
6,"Today you may want to go your own way regardless of what someone else wants, Sagittarius. Your independence is very important to you. However, compromise might be necessary in order to avoid serious conflict. Consider splitting your day to allow for the wishes of those close to you and time for yourself. If you can't make others understand why you want to be alone, this might be the best solution.",2,sagittarius,2018
7,"It's a good day to pull out that shopping list, Sagittarius. Your ability to be thrifty and efficient will be strengthened at this time, so why not take advantage of it? Take a few minutes to look through recent flyers or gather coupons before heading out. And if you find yourself feeling tempted to spend your savings on something lavish, get back to your list! Keep your budget in the forefront of your mind and head straight to the checkout when you're done.",2,sagittarius,2018
8,"Today is an excellent day to set some new goals, Sagittarius. When was the last time you did this? Many think that New Year's Day and birthdays are prime times to make resolutions or set goals, yet this is something that can be done any time. In fact, it's advisable to renew, rename, and revamp ambitions on a regular basis, since life brings constant change to circumstances. Pull out some paper and jot your ideas down.",2,sagittarius,2018
9,"It's a great day to set some of your ideas into motion, Sagittarius. The courage you need to forge ahead is available to you with this day's planetary aspects. All you need to do is use it. If your thoughts aren't clear, sit down and write your ideas out. Note the steps you need to take in order to get things rolling and then make your move. Don't let fear or insecurity hold you back!",2,sagittarius,2018
10,"Today you should feel more energetic, enthusiastic, and motivated than you have in a long time, Sagittarius. You feel very optimistic about your future, thanks to recent successes and support from those closest to you. As a result, your intellectual and creative faculties are more than inspired enough to move forward. The only downside is that there could be so many ideas coming to you that you might not be able to choose among them. Think about each one carefully before going ahead.",2,sagittarius,2018
11,"A chance to take a long journey, perhaps to a distant state or foreign country, could suddenly present itself to you today, Sagittarius. This trip is apt to be far more significant than a simple vacation. It may be career related or involve an opportunity to expand your education. It could also concern a relationship. Whichever it is, you're likely to make the trip and it will probably change your life in subtle ways.",2,sagittarius,2018
12,"A rush of excess ambition could cause you to channel a lot of your physical and mental energy into whatever work you're doing right now, Sagittarius. This might involve writing, teaching, or speaking in some way. As a result of your zeal, your body could be exhausted but your mind spinning like a top, even though the thoughts coming up may be scattered. It might be best to pace yourself now more than you're inclined to. Stay focused!",2,sagittarius,2018
13,"You may feel a bit of restriction working to hold you back from your current plans today, Sagittarius. It could be that your mind is feeling restless and that you’re anxious to go, but there’s a feeling of discipline and caution nagging you and urging you to slow down. This might not be a bad idea. Discipline and willpower may be exactly the things you need in order to get where you’re going.",2,sagittarius,2018
14,"Weirdness is the keyword for today, Sagittarius. You could be flooded with information from newspapers or the Internet that seems very strange to you. There's a reason for this. It's very likely to be misinformation! Don't be afraid to take it with a grain of salt, even though others take it very seriously. Hang on to your skepticism, and don't pass the information on unless you preface it with your honest opinion.",2,sagittarius,2018
15,"Success in business, perhaps involving writing or speaking, might come your way today, Sagittarius. Paperwork, such as contracts, could take up a lot of your time. You might also have to spend a lot of time on the phone or in the car. All this activity could have you feeling a bit frazzled. Nonetheless, you're going to feel very enthusiastic and optimistic about everything that's happening, and you should look forward to future enterprises. Enjoy!",2,sagittarius,2018
16,"This should be one of those days when you feel as if you could conquer the world. You feel strong and determined, Sagittarius, and willing to do whatever it takes to get wherever you want to be. A goal could be attained at this time, ambitions realized, or perhaps a lucky break could come your way. This is an excellent day to seek a new job, ask for a raise, or make a favorite project a success.",2,sagittarius,2018
17,"Today you’re likely to feel torn in two different directions, Sagittarius. A part of you could want to sequester yourself somewhere and read, while another part of you feels that you should get out, go somewhere, and do something. You may be more impatient than usual with squabbles between colleagues or family members. It might be a good idea to do some exercise during the day to work off the inner tensions. Relax with a good book in the evening!",2,sagittarius,2018
18,"Your imagination is flying high today, Sagittarius. Your interest in mystical and metaphysical matters is at an all-time high, and you could find yourself strolling through New Age bookstores. Travel to distant places may seem especially appealing, and you might dream of flying to India, Israel, Egypt, or Ireland. This is all wonderful as long as you stay grounded. Plan a trip if you can. Join a meditation group. Go with the flow!",2,sagittarius,2018
19,"Your home could be a very busy place today, Sagittarius. Visitors could come and go throughout the day, probably annoying you at times. You might also find yourself having to soothe angry outbursts on the part of a member of your household. Take care, however, that this person's problem doesn't get you so inflamed that you go into a fit of anger, too. Try to stay calm and focused and you'll get through the day.",2,sagittarius,2018
20,"Generally, you tend to be a very physically oriented person, Sagittarius, but today you’re more likely to want to look within, perhaps to experiment with your own psychic abilities or study spiritual concepts. You also might find yourself more interested than usual in the arts, particularly that which comes from other cultures. You'll be far more contemplative today than usual. It might prove enlightening to write down your thoughts.",2,sagittarius,2018
21,"Your creative talents could seem totally blocked today, Sagittarius. You may have a project you really want to work on. You have the mental focus, but the creative element just might not be there. This could prove so frustrating that you want to throw something. Do this if you must (preferably a pillow). Still, the only answer might be to shelve your work until tomorrow. You should be back to normal by then.",2,sagittarius,2018
22,"There’s no question about it, Sagittarius, you’ve been working hard these last few weeks. As an approaching deadline looms, you may find yourself waking up at night, running numbers through your head, and mentally rewriting project proposals. It's exhausting, to be sure, but know that the end result will make all this aggravation worthwhile.",2,sagittarius,2018
23,"You’re likely to be feeling the tug of distant lands, Sagittarius. Today you could stop at the travel agent’s office, the one you've walked by countless times, and stare at the pictures. Thailand, Hong Kong, and New Zealand are just a few of the places you'd like to see. The pictures look so enticing. Go ahead. Plan such a trip, although it’s likely to be only a temporary diversion. Your wanderlust indicates a fundamental restlessness that must be resolved.",2,sagittarius,2018
24,"Gloom may settle upon you today when you face your financial situation, Sagittarius. You may have had a lot of bills to pay, and thus your coffers could be a bit low for your liking. Still, this is only temporary, and it probably feels good to have the bills out of the way. Find something inexpensive, like reading, to keep you busy and get your mind off it. You're probably doing fine!",2,sagittarius,2018
25,"Your natural intuition and sensitivity will be heightened today, Sagittarius. You’re able to read the thoughts and feelings of others and interpret them accurately. Alas, you can’t use this skill as effectively on yourself. Some old issues have reemerged, causing you some distress. These issues are blocking you in some way. You won’t be able to move forward with your life until you resolve them once and for all. Perhaps a professional psychic could help.",2,sagittarius,2018
26,"While your enthusiasm is high, your resistance may be a bit low, Sagittarius. Take extra good care of yourself during this busy time. Your tendency is to overdo things, attending too many parties and shopping until the stores close. Your social life is in high gear right now, but you'll have to allow yourself some time to rest if you're going to have any hope of enjoying it.",2,sagittarius,2018
27,"Some bad news about your financial situation may not really be as bad as it first appears. Even so, it throws you for a loop. Double-check the information before spiraling into a panic, Sagittarius. It may be that a computer made an error or a bank clerk messed up. You may have to unravel some paperwork, but it will be a relief to have it resolved.",2,sagittarius,2018
28,"If you're taking a trip any time soon, Sagittarius, you can expect to experience a powerful attraction for someone you meet along the way. This will definitely make your journey more interesting; however, the friendship might not survive the trip. You may be from opposite sides of the country, and one or both of you could be involved with other people. Nonetheless, if neither of those restrictions applies, it's worth pursuing. Go for it!",2,sagittarius,2018
1,"This is unlike you, Sagittarius, but today you're a lean, mean cleaning machine. You get it in your head that this is the day for putting your house in order, and you set about single-handedly doing it. That's way too much cleaning and organizing for one person to do. Why not enlist some help? Bribe your partner or kids, play some loud music, and all of you will finish the tasks in no time.",3,sagittarius,2018
2,"Worries about money could be uppermost in your mind today, Sagittarius. You may have suffered some financial setbacks and wonder how you can muster enough funds to get over the hump. However, help is on the way. An outside source could provide funds to tide you over. Whatever other problems you may have will all be straightened out later. Your own ingenuity and a little help from your friends will probably see you through.",3,sagittarius,2018
3,"This could very well be one of those days in which you forget to put on your shoes before heading out the door, Sagittarius. Make sure your head is screwed on tight before you climb out of bed this morning; otherwise you might find it floating up in the clouds. Daydreams will seep into your consciousness no matter how hard you try to keep your mind focused on the matter at hand.",3,sagittarius,2018
4,"The rapid level of growth that you've probably been experiencing could suddenly prove too much for you today, Sagittarius. You might need to take a little breather to grasp what's happening in your life. New friends, new knowledge, and new opportunities have appeared in profusion, but you could still be feeling a bit down, wondering if you can handle it all. Don't fight these feelings; work through them instead. You'll be better off for it.",3,sagittarius,2018
5,"Today should find you continuing to work toward cherished career and other goals. Love matters may come to the forefront, Sagittarius. If you're currently involved, unexpected events could bring you that much closer to your partner. If you aren't involved, you could meet someone exciting, perhaps through some kind of group activities. Also, a longtime friend could suddenly appear to you in a new light. Whichever it is, expect some interesting developments.",3,sagittarius,2018
6,"The surge of power within you is going to let others know that you mean business, Sagittarius. Make good use of this fantastic boost of energy by conquering your own goals and demons instead of using it to wage war on anyone else. Other people should know to get out of your way when you have your mind set on doing something. If they don't, politely ask them to move instead of steamrolling over them.",3,sagittarius,2018
7,"This is meant to be a nice, relaxing day, so treat it as such, Sagittarius. There's no need for you to plan any great strategy at this time. Try to take it easy and not indulge in any unnecessary stress. This is your time to enjoy the moment. Don't tax your mind by overanalyzing everything that comes your way. Go with the flow and have a great time regardless of what you end up doing.",3,sagittarius,2018
8,"While your brain may want to charge ahead with new and revolutionary ideas, there is something holding you back from setting these ideas into motion, Sagittarius. It could be that there is a small voice in your head telling you to slow down and not automatically accept things and adopt them into your life just because they're new. Do your best to strike a balance between these two viewpoints.",3,sagittarius,2018
9,"Even if you aren't romantically involved, Sagittarius, you're likely to feel especially passionate today and anxious to schedule an intimate evening with someone who's caught your eye. You may not gallop off into the sunset right away, but you could dream of faraway lands. You might want to plan a trip. Be patient and don't overwhelm this person with too much passion too soon. Wait and see how things go.",3,sagittarius,2018
10,"Today is one of those days in which you might be kicking yourself for not telling the truth on an earlier occasion, Sagittarius. The words that seemed so harmless then may come back to haunt you now. Today is a very action-oriented day. Conflict could arise because what was thought to be true then now turns out to be false and counter to the action being taken at this time.",3,sagittarius,2018
11,"There is a strong wave of power coming your way, so be careful how you handle it, Sagittarius. You're extra prone to injuries and accidents of an explosive nature. Try not to make any hasty moves while driving, and be careful operating things like gas pumps or propane tanks. Used properly, today's planetary energy can help you tackle just about any obstacle in front of you. How you handle the energy is up to you.",3,sagittarius,2018
12,"Show some gratitude to the people around you today, Sagittarius. The seat of your personality is very strong at this time, and you're confident to your core. Mix this feeling with the service-oriented sensitivity of the day that asks us to do things for others. Keep in mind that a gesture as simple as a smile and word of appreciation can be healing for another person - and you.",3,sagittarius,2018
13,"You have a great deal of power at your disposal today, Sagittarius. You should keep in mind that just about anything you wish for will come true. Don't waste words or actions. Concentrate your energy and focus it on one or two important things instead of dispersing it and thereby diluting your overall power. There isn't anything to fear on a day like this.",3,sagittarius,2018
14,"Congratulations, Sagittarius! You've finally reached a goal you've been working toward for a long time.

15,"Yikes! What an emotional day, Sagittarius. The planetary energies are forecasting conflict, and lots of it. Do your best to personally steer clear of any of it, and try to avoid being drawn into any arguments. You may wish to keep to yourself today. Tonight either stay in or head out to the movies alone. Don't worry, everyone will be feeling much better tomorrow.",3,sagittarius,2018
16,"You may get a chance to make some extra money today, perhaps by working overtime. However, this might interfere with a social event that you've committed to, and could cause disappointment among your friends and family members. It could also give rise to a little trouble with your partner. However, remind yourself that this disappointment will pass, and the money will be more than welcome. Hang in there!",3,sagittarius,2018
17,"You may find it hard to connect with your emotions today, Sagittarius. It could be that it's difficult to find a bit of quiet time when you can really sit down and listen to your inner voice. There are distractions all around that are pulling you in many different directions. Keep in mind that these forces aren't necessarily acting in your best interests.",3,sagittarius,2018
18,"Career matters are at the forefront of your concerns today, Sagittarius. Opportunities for advancement may suddenly appear that you weren't aware of yesterday, and you'll need to make snap decisions and go for what you want right away.

There's an element of genius to the day that might inspire you to be someone much greater than you ever thought you could be. Join with people who share your same zest for life.",3,sagittarius,2018
20,"Money could be a source of worry today, Sagittarius. You might feel you've spent too much (who doesn't sometimes?) or perhaps some funds you were expecting have been held up. This is a delay and not a permanent situation (although it might seem that way). Too much worry could spoil your day, and you don't want that. If there's anything you can do to ease the situation, do it. Otherwise, hang in there.",3,sagittarius,2018
21,"Travel and adventure are on your mind. You could be daydreaming about flying to exotic places and doing unusual things, such as touring the ancient sights of India or going on safari in Kenya. Such dreams are possible, Sagittarius, so you might want to look into it. You also might want to learn about exciting fields of interest, so this is a good day to sign up for a class or workshop.",3,sagittarius,2018

Your ambition and concentration have led and will continue to lead to significant accomplishment, which isn't likely to escape the notice of those above you in the hierarchy. Draw satisfaction from your achievements and continue as you are.",3,sagittarius,2018
24,"Spiritual occurrences could lead to a very powerful healing experience, Sagittarius. Repressed past traumas could come to the surface and be processed and released. This could leave you feeling rather dazed, as this purging could open a gap in your psyche. Don't worry; eventually it will fill with new knowledge and insights instead of psychic garbage! For now, take a walk. It will clear your head and help you deal with it all.",3,sagittarius,2018
25,"This isn't the day to take care of paperwork, Sagittarius, particularly if it involves money. Your mental processes are slower than usual, and you may find that you're easily distracted. Your mood won't be all that great either, so it might be a good idea to wait a few days before tackling tasks like this. If the work is urgent, ask for help. You'll be able to stay more focused if you do.",3,sagittarius,2018
26,"Your mind is probably taking a mystical turn, Sagittarius. This is a great day to study spiritual or metaphysical concepts or expand your knowledge of fields like astrology, numerology, or the other occult sciences.

Your mate will likely be quite appreciative!",3,sagittarius,2018
28,"Love certainly seems to make the world go round today, Sagittarius. Is everyone around you deeply involved in a new or revitalized romance?

30,"Developments over the past few days could have you feeling very excited and particularly optimistic about your love life, Sagittarius.

31,"Love matters could have you feeling uptight and somewhat fearful today, Sagittarius. Perhaps this involves a relationship that hasn't really manifested yet, or maybe you and your beloved have had a dispute of some kind. Don't worry too much.

2,"You could be thinking some bizarre thoughts today, Sagittarius. They might lead you in a direction that doesn't quite pertain to your current situation.

There's an element of fantasy operating that's making it difficult for you to see the whole picture.",4,sagittarius,2018
5,"For a few weeks now you've understood that each day brings its share of constraints, Sagittarius. For example, today you could feel doubts about your physical appearance. Are you questioning your attractiveness or your ability to make an impression on someone special? Did you use bad judgment at some point, and you're now afraid that you've hurt your reputation? A decision you make at the end of the day will relieve these anxieties.",4,sagittarius,2018
6,"This is the ideal moment to address once and for all the questions that have been on your mind for the last three weeks, Sagittarius. Pay particular attention to questions that touch on your sentimental side. If you're currently involved in unsatisfactory relationships, don't be afraid to leave them behind.

7,"Some rather upsetting news about a friend could come to you today, Sagittarius, probably over the phone. This could be the truth, but more likely the facts have been distorted in the retelling. In fact, what you're hearing may actually be nothing more than gossip. Phone someone who might know what's really going on, preferably the friend you heard about, and check the facts before driving yourself crazy.",4,sagittarius,2018
8,"A social event could bring you into contact with a very intense, fascinating person in an intriguing profession, Sagittarius. You could find him or her very charming and sexy.

You could seem somewhat transformed when you leave the party tonight.",4,sagittarius,2018
9,"Overindulgence in food and drink over the past few days could be causing you to feel a little out of sorts today, Sagittarius. You might even wonder if the fun was worth it!

12,"Communication with friends, siblings, and neighbors should be open, congenial, and supportive today, Sagittarius. A gathering could open the door to new friendships, interesting discussions, and other group activities that you might enjoy. The only downside could involve mental overload. You might learn so much today that you can't keep track of it all. Take notes so you can maintain a record of everything that particularly impresses you.",4,sagittarius,2018
13,"You should make an effort to be patient and tolerant, especially at the office, even though you might not feel like it, Sagittarius. You'll likely take a lot of deep breaths as projects get delayed and meetings drag on. There isn't much you can do about it. Stay focused and trust that everything will be resolved by day's end. In the meantime, don't step on anyone's toes. Your colleagues' nerves are raw.",4,sagittarius,2018

Social activities are also highlighted, so treat your team to lunch to celebrate.",4,sagittarius,2018
16,"Tugs on the home front could be pulling you away from attending an event with friends that you've been looking forward to for some time. Try to be reasonable and sort out the needs of those at home with kindness in your heart. You might be able to address those issues and still have time to be with your friends later. Just remember to keep your priorities straight, Sagittarius.",4,sagittarius,2018
17,"This is one day for you to be as flexible as possible, Sagittarius. It may be that you begin with a specific list of items that absolutely must be done, but get distracted by some news from a friend or co-worker. What had seemed so important is no longer so, and your day shifts to accommodate this new piece of information. You'll be rather surprised by but no less satisfied with how the day turns out.",4,sagittarius,2018
18,"You have much to be grateful for, Sagittarius. Why not go out tonight and celebrate with friends? Forget about work and family troubles and kick up your heels. Have a high old time. You deserve the break. If you don't seize these moments when you have the opportunity, you risk becoming a single-minded individual who thinks only of work at the expense of life's other great pleasures.",4,sagittarius,2018
19,"You've been working hard lately and deserve the professional acclaim that comes your way, Sagittarius. As a result of your efforts, it's likely you've received or will soon receive a bonus, raise, or promotion of some kind. Celebrate, but just one night. If you let the party continue indefinitely, the bill could be too large even for you! Be frugal and work hard. That's your real ticket to the good life.",4,sagittarius,2018
20,"This is going to be one of those days when you get annoyed if someone takes too long to make up his or her mind about something, Sagittarius. You aren't going to have the patience to abide anyone who continues to go over every single detail of an issue. You're more likely to want to simply make a decision, for better or worse.",4,sagittarius,2018
21,"The atmosphere around you could seem somewhat unreal today. If you get a weird vibe from someone, Sagittarius, take everything this person says with a grain of salt. He or she has an agenda and isn't above distorting the truth to achieve it. If what they say doesn't affect you, don't worry about it. If it does, take pains to learn the facts before acting on it. You'll be glad you did.",4,sagittarius,2018
22,"Expect to exchange a lot of phone calls and emails with friends today, Sagittarius. Communication with others is your top priority. You have a lot of news to deliver and you'll receive a lot in return. Much of what you hear could be useful for whatever you're involved with now. The only downside is mental overload. You could feel as if your brain has spent the day running a marathon.",4,sagittarius,2018
23,"Your desire to respect and honor the special someone in your life clashes today with an equally strong desire to become a passionate persuader, Sagittarius. The secret to resolving this conflict lies in knowing that the two aren't mutually exclusive. Also, if you're going to make the most of both drives, you need to tune in to your partner's thoughts and feelings. Zero in on what you both want and then go for it! Enjoy your day.",4,sagittarius,2018
24,"This would be a good day to putter about the house, Sagittarius. It isn't a good day to travel or begin any major projects. This could be just the excuse you've needed for taking a day off from your life! You need not answer the phone or fulfill any obligations whatsoever. Simply stay put and tackle some minor household chores. If even that proves too much, then curl up with some tea and a good book.",4,sagittarius,2018
25,"Things aren't always as they first appear. People you thought you knew well and circumstances that you thought you understood thoroughly now seem anything but straightforward. Has the world really changed that much or has your perception altered somehow? It's time to direct this “altered” vision inward. You're ready for a change, Sagittarius. Perhaps it's time to dust off that resume.",4,sagittarius,2018
26,"One couldn't really say that you have a hard time making decisions regarding your love life, Sagittarius. You're a passionate person and you believe in love at first sight. You're probably the most spontaneous lover in your immediate circle! Add to that, you're entering a period in which your emotions will be heightened. All the elements are there to ignite your creativity in every aspect of your life.",4,sagittarius,2018
27,"You're looking beautiful and feeling passionate, Sagittarius. If only your passions could be reciprocated! Even though there may not be anyone special in your life right now, that's no reason to not treat yourself well. Go out for a nice meal or, better yet, order take-out and dine at home, complete with music, candles, and your finest china. You should appreciate yourself even if no one else does at the moment.",4,sagittarius,2018
28,"Some disturbing dreams could bring up doubts you may have about the motives of someone you consider a friend, Sagittarius. This person might have been acting strangely, and you could be wondering about the future of your friendship. It's important to look at the symbols in the dreams and try to analyze what they're telling you. They might be indicating your friend, you, or both. Think about it!",4,sagittarius,2018
29,"Today your relationships with just about everyone - friends, relatives, colleagues, and romantic partners - should be going very well, Sagittarius. Your communication is good, and your ability to see the other person's point of view is clearer than usual. This might be a bit disconcerting, as it could conflict with your viewpoint, but bear in mind you don't have to agree with others to learn from them. Enjoy your day.",4,sagittarius,2018
30,"Memories and emotions welling up from the past might excite your creative impulses today, Sagittarius. You may not quite be able to understand what all of this means, but the pictures should keep coming to you nonetheless. It might be a good idea to take some notes, even though you might not comprehend all you write. This may be more a process of releasing ancient traumas than creating great masterpieces, but even so, it's worth pursuing.",4,sagittarius,2018
1,"Today the celestial energy will be trying to teach you something, Sagittarius, specifically, how to share with others. But first you must get to a place where you truly want to share something of yourself. Have you examined your tendency to run away? You seem to be afraid that they'll overwhelm you or that you'll owe them something. This isn't the case, Sagittarius. Why not give other people a chance to get to know you?",5,sagittarius,2018
2,"Are you getting hit with obstacles, Sagittarius? Could it be that you simply need to allot yourself more time to complete the monumental tasks you take on? This might be difficult for you to tolerate. You don't know how to deal with times like these when you must continue doing the same thing over and over until you get results. There's a lesson here for you. Remember that patience is a virtue.",5,sagittarius,2018
3,"When you talk, you want other people to listen, Sagittarius. More than likely, your thoughts will drift toward humanitarian ideas and philosophies. You're eager to share your ideas with others, and you may have a utopian dream that, if everyone just followed, would make the world a much better place. People may make fun of you for having such a perspective, but this definitely doesn't mean that you should stop dreaming.",5,sagittarius,2018
4,"You have a rather strange day in front of you, Sagittarius. The celestial atmosphere could be playing tricks on you. You might get aggravated for no reason at all, that is, unless it's because you've been meeting too many people who don't appreciate the original way you go about doing things. You may feel as if you live in a world full of dinosaurs. Don't give up yet!",5,sagittarius,2018
5,"Gloom over money matters might catch up with you at some point today, Sagittarius. However, there's nothing really major to worry about. Financially, your business affairs should be going well, so you're probably doing better than you think. A little caution might be in order, especially regarding impulse buying or purchasing luxuries. You don't want to end up having to take items back to the store.",5,sagittarius,2018
6,"Although your mind may have been a bit clouded over the past few days, today the fog should clear and you'll feel more focused. Money matters might need some attention, Sagittarius, and you're in just the right space to dig in and take care of them.

With a great deal of physical energy coupled with incredibly high self-esteem, you have what it takes to make a major push toward larger goals.

Your strong, courageous nature is ripe for hopping aboard when that train comes zooming by.",5,sagittarius,2018
8,"You need to slow down in matters of love and romance, Sagittarius. You're likely acting on the assumption that things are fine and you can continue moving at lightning speed even though you long ago lost your road map. There's a degree of fantasy in your world. It doesn't take into account the fact that there are areas where you need to be more sensitive to your partner and perhaps take things more slowly and methodically.",5,sagittarius,2018
9,"You have a lot of thinking to do about your professional goals, Sagittarius. You'll go over the elements to see if there isn't some way to approach things differently. Are there new paths you could try or ways to improve things? Your mind will go a thousand miles a minute today. Those who spend time with you may be totally exhausted by the end of the day because of all the questions you ask!",5,sagittarius,2018
10,"At last, a day of relief from the tension! The flow of communication facilitates personal and professional projects. Now is the time to listen to your partner or other family members about the material aspects of the future. For example, are you setting aside enough money for your children's education? Are you taking proper care of your home? Are your investments allocated correctly? These are all issues worth considering today.",5,sagittarius,2018
11,"You must have felt the pressure rising in the past week. Intense, isn't it? Do you have a job to finish at the last minute? Is there some ill humor or misunderstanding among your relations? Are you dissatisfied with yourself? Today you can make a fresh start, complete with good resolutions. You thought you'd worked hard enough, but guess what? The task is only beginning!",5,sagittarius,2018
12,"The little fighter that you are makes it very difficult for you to join us in the great communal river that we're all trying to navigate, Sagittarius. You prefer to travel solo, going down your private stream as you see fit. However, these are opportune days to try joining up with others. Some events may occur to remind you of the benefits of community.",5,sagittarius,2018
13,"An exciting new project or opportunity could be presented to you today, Sagittarius. It could involve a new love or at least a new friend.

14,"The celestial energy signals a pleasant change for you today, Sagittarius. Finally, the overpowering emotions that have been surging from your relationships will subside.

15,"A small crisis is still a crisis, isn't it, Sagittarius? Expect one in your personal life today. Since you aren't one to let issues go unresolved, you won't be able to put off dealing with your problems any longer. Questions abound. Are work and responsibilities shared equally with your partner? Are you both making an equal effort to maintain relationship harmony? Asking the questions is the first step to answering them.",5,sagittarius,2018
16,"Sagittarius, this is an ideal moment to address once and for all the questions that have been on your mind for the last few weeks. Pay particular attention to questions that touch on your sentimental life. If you're currently involved in unsatisfactory relationships, don't be afraid to leave them behind. If you're fretting about an unanswered request, let it go. No response is forthcoming.",5,sagittarius,2018
17,"You may feel rather lazy and out of touch today, Sagittarius. It could be that your emotions have taken a stronger hold on your psyche than your rational way of thinking. Therefore, making decisions might be quite difficult. In matters of the heart, you could feel a bit more romantic than usual. There is a great sentimental mood to the day that's causing you to empathize with others.",5,sagittarius,2018
18,"Sometimes people might reproach you for being less than tactful in relationships, Sagittarius. However, today's planetary energies are going to help you be more sensitive. You'll feel as though you suddenly have a much greater capacity for listening. Whether it's true or not, others will have the impression that you are no longer so self-centered.",5,sagittarius,2018
19,"Having a personal opinion on any question isn't the most difficult thing in the world to do, Sagittarius. More difficult is confronting with some objectivity the opinions of others. The current celestial energy is marking a change toward a mindset that is more scientifically oriented. This is no longer the moment to affirm yourself but rather to learn from others.",5,sagittarius,2018
20,"There's a solid grounding to the day that might have you feeling less than energetic about getting the ball rolling, Sagittarius. Don't be surprised if there's a sense of restriction and duty weighing you down. Times of rest and reflection are very important in the natural cycle. Don't think that you always need to be on the go in order to make progress. Put your warring nature aside today and rest.",5,sagittarius,2018
21,"The intensity of the day could work for you in one of two ways, Sagittarius. You can either be depressed and weighed down by the intense emotionalism that's likely to well up, or you can take this incredible intensity and put it to good use. The choice is yours. Realize that any action you take is going to be highly charged with feelings. Likewise, others will be extra sensitive about any move you make.",5,sagittarius,2018
22,"You can expect to be more and more interested in new technologies these days, Sagittarius. What you once considered very progressive now seems much closer to reality. You'll notice to what an extent it is now crucial for you to align yourself with the cutting-edge technology that surrounds you. Don't hesitate.

Get up, eat a good breakfast, take a brisk walk, and face the day renewed.",5,sagittarius,2018

You should take this opportunity to reset your dials and make big plans for your ideal future.",5,sagittarius,2018
28,"Any argument you start today is likely to erupt into a brutal emotional battle, Sagittarius, so beware. Try not to tread on anyone else's turf, because you'll find that he or she is likely to be possessive and rather belligerent about defending what is rightfully theirs. Avoid volcanic eruptions of energy. Don't pick fights where they aren't needed. You can civilly resolve issues without doing harm to others.",5,sagittarius,2018

31,"It's important for you to be extra cautious today, Sagittarius. Make sure you're calm and collected before you get behind the wheel of a car.

Be careful of such tendencies.",5,sagittarius,2018
1,"Your emotions could be a bit vulnerable today, Sagittarius, and it may be hard to find shelter from the storm. Your umbrella is a bit too drafty and water seems to be leaking in from the top.

Creative ideas should flow freely. Have fun.",6,sagittarius,2018
3,"Today you could feel especially intuitive and more sensitive than usual to unacceptable social and political conditions, Sagittarius. Ideas for new goals, perhaps humanitarian, might come to you.

Then decide how to proceed.",6,sagittarius,2018
4,"Communication with those closest to you might prove difficult today, Sagittarius. You might end up playing endless phone tag. This can be a bit distressing, because you're feeling especially warm and loving toward them right now. You might even worry that perhaps they're angry and don't want to talk to you. This isn't the case. Keep trying. You'll eventually reach them and receive the response you want.",6,sagittarius,2018

The action is just around the corner, and you'll need all your capacities.",6,sagittarius,2018

You may even discover that people can respect and appreciate you even if you aren't constantly on the defensive.",6,sagittarius,2018

You always seem to be running around, so much so, in fact, that you've been neglecting the people close to you, especially your family. They really need you. They have issues to discuss with you.

What you do today provides the blueprint for your future. Continued efforts to stabilize your behavior will provide the security you desire for the future.",12,capricorn,2017
25,"Communication is a big theme of the day for you. Every time you speak, a large audience is listening to every word. The stronger you are at expressing your opinions, the better. You're flighty today, jumping from one thing to the next, but this is fine. You may get quite a bit done when you act in this fashion.",12,capricorn,2017
26,"Your legendary impatience is playing tricks on you. You're in too much of a hurry. You may have changed things on the outside but you haven't changed who you really are. Resist the temptation to sweep everything away to start all over again. If you did, in a few months you'd just be back where you started. Think about a better approach.",12,capricorn,2017
27,"It appears that today and for the past several days you've been building up internal tension without an outlet. As a result, your fuse is somewhat short. In fact, if anyone is unfortunate enough to provoke your anger by criticizing you or your work, you're liable to explode. There's a storm brewing! Try to weather it as best you can.",12,capricorn,2017
28,"You might find your emotions stifled today. You have a great deal to say, but for some reason there's a bit of hesitation when it comes to saying it. Don't be surprised if you feel anxious in such a way that makes it difficult to communicate. Much of today's talk may be filled with fluff and not much substance.",12,capricorn,2017
29,"Today, you may feel especially sociable. You might want to look up old friends you haven't seen for a while, perhaps to release past quarrels or hurt feelings. Take care to release them instead of bringing them up again. You could feel more sensitive than usual, and so any sort of explanation may lead to friction. Be aware of your friends' good qualities so you can enjoy their company.",12,capricorn,2017
30,"Question the validity of anything you find yourself in conflict with today, Capricorn. You might find that people are acting on incomplete information and that they are falsely accusing you of something you didn't say or do. Work to bring harmony to the situation by getting the truth out on the table and helping the actual motivations become known. Words may be charged with strong emotions, so be gentle with your actions.",12,capricorn,2017
31,"A goal that you've been trying to reach may be temporarily stalled, Capricorn, and you could be tempted to slip into despair, wondering if it will ever really happen. Remember that the keyword for today is ""temporary."" Whatever obstacles are in your way will eventually be overcome and your goal should be to continue to advance in the direction you want. In the meantime, take care of your chores. They may be boring, but they're necessary!",12,capricorn,2017
1,"Today, Capricorn, you should be feeling especially energetic and enthusiastic. Therefore, this is a great day to start a new enterprise, perhaps involving your home, or just about any kind of life enhancement. More than one opportunity could present itself to you. One could entail creative activities and the other might be more mundane. Undoubtedly, whether you decide to take both or only one, you're going to be busy for a while. Work hard!",1,capricorn,2018
2,"It seems that you're ready for a major change in your life, Capricorn. But take care that you don't implement change merely for the sake of change. Think carefully about what you really want to do. Some introspection just might reveal that the changes you seek are minor rather than major. You may simply want to begin working on your health a bit more. Jogging a few days a week and vowing to eat salads at lunch rather than sandwiches may bring about a wonderful ripple effect of health and well-being in your life.",1,capricorn,2018
3,"Today you'll likely find that you begin to make real progress on a project that may have been stagnating for a while, Capricorn. You can't help but feel gratified that all of your hard work is finally beginning to pay off. Good for you! You have earned every success that is due to come your way. But don't rest on your laurels! Continue to work hard so that you can achieve even greater recognition.",1,capricorn,2018
4,"Romance is in the air today, Capricorn. It's the perfect time to make yourself look your best and invite that certain someone to dinner. Even if you're already happily married, why not take advantage of the auspicious mood and plan a special date with your spouse? Even old married couples are entitled to romance now and then!",1,capricorn,2018
5,"Today you might feel a little gloomy without knowing why, Capricorn, and you could spend a lot of time trying to find a reason. There probably isn't any concrete reason. It's likely that you're simply responding to low biorhythms. This is, therefore, a great day to go for a workout. This way you can get the endorphins going and feel a lot better by late afternoon. Then you should actually feel like going out and having some fun.",1,capricorn,2018
6,"Your level of health and physical well-being is likely to be very high, Capricorn, and thus you're probably glowing. As a result, you might find that those around you pay more attention to what you're saying than they usually do. You'll also find that your mind is especially sharp, and you're apt to be exceptionally quick on the uptake. Therefore, you might absorb a lot more from what you hear than you normally do. Make a note of it!",1,capricorn,2018
7,"Your warmth and good nature draw people to you like a magnet today, Capricorn. Of course, you're used to this occurring, but today these aspects of your character are especially enhanced. You will find that encounters with other people leave you feeling full and satisfied. After all, it is our loved ones who truly make life worth living. The time is ripe for romantic encounters.",1,capricorn,2018
8,"A lack of contact with a romantic partner could have you feeling a little down right now, Capricorn. You may be wondering if you've said or done anything that offended your beloved one in some way. Your friend, however, is apt to be totally oblivious to the idea that you're upset. Your partner is probably taking care of some family obligations and may have lost track of time. Hang in there! Your honey should get in touch with you soon.",1,capricorn,2018
9,"It isn't nearly as bad as you think, Capricorn. In fact, things are definitely looking up. Of course, you'll never know that if you refuse to drag yourself out of bed to see for yourself. Your hard work of the last few months has left you enervated and somewhat drained. But today you begin to see the payoff! It's time to get up, get dressed, and dazzle the world with your brilliance. You know you can do it.",1,capricorn,2018
10,"Intellectual or spiritual concepts that you're trying to grasp may seem a little elusive, Capricorn. Don't try to push yourself too hard to understand them today; you'll only confuse yourself that much more. You're not losing it; your mental biorhythms are simply low. Instead, look at something else for a while, and let the information churn around in your subconscious. It may hit you tomorrow and you'll want to cry, ""Eureka!"" Be patient with yourself.",1,capricorn,2018
11,"Surprising and very fortunate events could take place today, Capricorn. This could be an advancement that you weren't expecting. The introduction of an interesting new person or the beginning of an exciting new project could raise your pulse. The day should therefore pass by very quickly. Tonight you may want to share your excitement with your partner or another family member.",1,capricorn,2018
12,"You've been working very hard for a long time, Capricorn, and now you might be thinking of ways to reward yourself. A trip that you might have dreamed of taking might suddenly seem to be more attainable. Today you might decide to actually make the arrangements. You could well decide to stay for a long time, for there is much that you can learn through this trip.",1,capricorn,2018
13,"A friend you've known for years might suddenly shock you by saying some unkind things that you would never have expected of him or her, Capricorn. If they're said about you, you might be very upset because it isn't fair or justified! Sometimes it's hard to forgive these things, but make the effort. Your friend is going through some rough times that you may not know about. Try to put yourself in the other's shoes. Forgive and forget.",1,capricorn,2018
14,"Newspapers, books, and TV are apt to bring a lot of new, exciting, and useful information your way, Capricorn. This might set your mind going in such a direction as to bring new ideas for projects or business opportunities your way. Discussions with others who share your interests could contribute even more. Expect an exciting and stimulating day, and by day's end you're likely to have opened up new doors for yourself.",1,capricorn,2018
15,"A powerful romantic attraction might lead to creative or artistic inspiration. You should be feeling especially passionate today, Capricorn, and your passions are likely to spill over not only into your relationships but into your work as well. Whatever you produce creatively is likely to be so inspired it impresses even you. Work done on the job should attract favorable attention from superiors. You're feeling especially sexy. Dress up and see what happens!",1,capricorn,2018
16,"Today you might find yourself at a loss as to how to proceed with a particular task or project in which you're involved, Capricorn. There might be a number of options open to you, all workable, and this could prove confusing. If all options are efficient and practical, don't agonize over your decision. Flip a coin if you have to! Success is strongly indicated if you don't stress yourself out in the process.",1,capricorn,2018
17,"Letters or phone calls could come today reaffirming the continued success you've been enjoying and presenting new opportunities, Capricorn. Your mind should be in a very good space to consider anything new that comes your way, and your common sense is high so you're apt to see all sides of it. Therefore, whatever you have to think about, trust yourself! You tend to be innately practical and efficient, but today you're even more so.",1,capricorn,2018
18,"Visitors in the home could share stories of strange experiences of some sort, perhaps intense and vivid dreams, visions, or maybe premonitions that have come true. This could spark some deep thought, Capricorn, causing you to reflect on similar experiences of your own. It might be a good idea for you and your friends to attend some classes or workshops on psychic development. The experiences will probably continue, and they're more understandable when you know what to look for.",1,capricorn,2018
19,"Today, you may find you have a certain gift for productivity. Everything you touch turns to gold, yet you may be under the impression that you can't provide everything you need for yourself. So what do you do? You start buying everything in sight! Today you might want to think about this bad little habit of yours, Capricorn. You may be tempted to go on a big shopping spree. But you won't be very happy with yourself when you get the credit card bill!",1,capricorn,2018
20,"Today is a good day to take chances, Capricorn. You may be quite successful if you're ready to defend the things you really care about. Pretend that you're the director of a film and that you've just met a potential producer for your movie. You just happen to have your script in hand. Are you ready to move up in the world? Are you ready for success?",1,capricorn,2018
21,"This is probably going to shape up to be a busy and rather chaotic day. You might find yourself spending a lot of time out and about, Capricorn. You may need to run a lot of errands and see a number of people. A friend might accompany you. Phone calls might need to be made in order to make arrangements for future events, and someone might take up too much of your time calling to chat. Pace yourself!",1,capricorn,2018
22,"Business transactions taking place in your near neighborhood should prove sensible and satisfying today, Capricorn. You should be feeling pretty financially secure right now, as career and money matters continue to go well for you.

In the evening, take a brisk walk near your home.",1,capricorn,2018
23,"Creative inspiration flows freely today, Capricorn, enabling you to channel it in more than one way. An opportunity to earn a sizable fee doing something artistic could come your way. Spiritual or metaphysical studies may be involved. This might represent the attainment of a long-term goal you've been striving to reach, and therefore you're apt to be rather excited about it. Tonight, go out and celebrate your success with your friends.",1,capricorn,2018
24,"It could be that you don't feel as if you can begin your day until you've made it clear to someone that you have an issue that needs to be dealt with, Capricorn. You have a greater amount of emotional strength than usual, and you'll find that it's important that you hold on to this feeling against all odds. Other people may try to strike you down with their words, but pay attention to what they're saying. Are they really focusing on the facts or just blasting you with their opinions?",1,capricorn,2018
25,"A temporary setback with regard to your career might have you feeling a bit disoriented right now, Capricorn. Modern equipment of some kind might be involved. Don't make yourself crazy; this is only temporary and will be straightened out. Your own determination, efficiency, and practical abilities should have it taken care of in no time. Basically, you're probably feeling quite optimistic for the future and not likely to change that energy any time soon.",1,capricorn,2018
26,"A focused and enhanced practical turn of mind, strengthened by intuition, may be of great help to you today when considering career matters, Capricorn. A change is in the wind and you might want to give considerable thought to different options that may be opening up to you. Don't think you have to rush into making a decision, however. It might be a good idea to let different possibilities simmer in your subconscious for a day or so.",1,capricorn,2018
27,"Remember that no one can make you feel inferior without your consent, Capricorn. It might seem as if others are trying to show you up today with their knowledge about the world and how it should be run. Don't let them talk you into believing that your thoughts and ideas are any less valid than theirs. At the same time, it's important for you to stay open-minded and accepting of other people's ideas.",1,capricorn,2018
28,"Overwork and the resulting stress and nerve strain might result in fevers or headaches today, Capricorn. Therefore, it might be a good idea to start out the day pacing yourself and concentrating on whatever tasks are the most pressing. Don't worry if you have to leave some for later. There is a chance that others around you might get into some rather heated arguments. Stay out of it. This will only make you feel worse.",1,capricorn,2018
29,"Your emotions are likely to deceive you today, so be careful about making a judgment about something, Capricorn. Make sure that you take your time and gather all the necessary facts or else you may end up making an impulsive decision that you regret later on. The situations and people you encounter today are apt to be stubborn, emotional, or unreliable. If this is so, simply back away and address these things at some other time.",1,capricorn,2018
30,"Idealistic love could come your way today, Capricorn. This might involve a colleague or possibly someone in a group with which you're affiliated. It might even be someone you've never before considered as more than a friend. Whoever it is may seem to be too perfect to be true. Bear in mind that this is the first rush of infatuation, and that for romance to be successful you have to love a person's flaws as well.",1,capricorn,2018
31,"Surprising news about your own finances and the world economy in general could cause you to feel confident and secure about your financial future, Capricorn. An unexpected raise in salary could come your way soon, possibly because of sudden changes at your workplace. Some of the information that you receive could seem vague and uncertain at first, but whatever news follows should clear it up. It seems a celebration is in order!",1,capricorn,2018
1,"Romance is in the air, Capricorn, and all of a sudden you notice that all around you couples are walking hand-in-hand, exchanging longing gazes. This could get you thinking about your own situation. If you want to make a move toward someone in the department of love and romance, feel free to go ahead, but don't get too hung up on positive results. If you get your hopes up too high, you might end up falling hard. Just take it easy.",2,capricorn,2018
2,"There may be a big conflict in your life that you seem almost powerless to control at this time, Capricorn. It could feel like a war is raging around you and all you want is for it to stop. Whether you realize it or not, you do have a part to play in this situation and you certainly do have the power to affect the outcome of this quarrel. Take responsibility for your actions and step up to the plate.",2,capricorn,2018
3,"Is your imagination brimming over with ideas for new projects, Capricorn? Are you drawing upon old memories for inspiration? Your past can be a very fruitful resource; however, today you may find that some of these recollections make you feel more emotional than you should. Let them all go. This is a necessary release. Channeling your feelings into creative work could prove cathartic. By the end of the day you should feel great. Go with the flow.",2,capricorn,2018
4,"Chances are that you'll feel upbeat and positive today, Capricorn. Consider sharing this energy with those around you who are feeling less than content. Your attitude can have a profound effect on friends, partners, spouses, and children. Even neighbors and extended family can pick up on your spirit without you even realizing it. Share your optimism with everyone you can today. If you see someone hurt or angry, tell him or her that everything will eventually work out and to keep trying.",2,capricorn,2018
5,"Today should go well for you, Capricorn. Expect to feel a renewed energy and perspective on things, especially those that are work related. Make the most of this by working toward finishing projects that are waiting for you or by cleaning and organizing your desk or broom closet. Feel confident that you'll be able to handle most any task in no time. When everything you wanted to get done is taken care of, make some plans for a little recreation. You deserve it.",2,capricorn,2018
6,"Today may well find you in the mood to head out on a venture or visit someone, Capricorn. When was the last time you took a day for something like this? Chances are it's been too long. Not only will you enjoy it but others will be thrilled to have some time with you as well. Whether you pack up the whole family or head out on your own, seize the opportunity to visit a new place or connect with people you haven't seen in a while.",2,capricorn,2018
7,"Chances are good that you'll be keeping yourself busy today, Capricorn. The energetic aspects that are occurring can really have you raring to take on chores that need to be done. Can you think of anything you'd rather do? Well, OK, but once you've finished these things, there should be plenty of time to do something recreational, too. Make the most of this great day to get into both work and play.",2,capricorn,2018
8,"Another person will probably bring you much comfort today, Capricorn. It could be someone you know well, but chances are it will be someone you’d least expect to be there for you. With your tendency to keep to yourself and be on the quiet side, you may not always notice those around you. Yet this doesn't mean that they don't notice you. Embrace a new friend and the support offered when the opportunity arises.",2,capricorn,2018
9,"A renewed sense of values and integrity may be present for you today, Capricorn. Connecting with this can be extremely uplifting, as it can put everything into perspective for you.

If you keep a journal, explore your mood on paper.",2,capricorn,2018

Matters involving home and family might need some attention right now, though in a very positive way. You'll notice that your inner power is much higher than usual today, as if you could move mountains. Go for it!",2,capricorn,2018
11,"Some traumas, phobias, or hang-ups from the past that have been limiting you in some way could suddenly come to the surface today, Capricorn. You might get the most insight by analyzing your dreams. The release could be so profound that you have to spend some time alone today, perhaps away from the house, in order to fully grasp it all. At the end of the day you should feel elated because you'll now see your way toward getting past some of your obstacles.",2,capricorn,2018
12,"An upcoming visit from someone close may have you working overtime in order to fix up your house, Capricorn. Therefore, you could be tempted to go crazy buying decorative items. This is fine up to a point, but be careful! Some of the stuff that looks good in the store might not look quite the same once you get it home. Your guest is more interested in seeing you. Decorate in moderation, and have fun doing it!",2,capricorn,2018
13,"You’ll find that a sensitive mind that’s open to everything and every possibility is exactly the thing you need at this time in order to be successful in reaching all the goals you’re working toward, Capricorn. You’ll find that your sense of duty and need for plans and solid goals are key elements for getting to where you need to be. Gather information and create a plan of attack that is well thought out.",2,capricorn,2018
14,"Rumors may be circulating today, Capricorn, which could cause a certain panic. Some of your friends and colleagues could be calling you at home to discuss the matter. However, these rumors are probably based on little more than gossip, so don't take them seriously. Someone could have an axe to grind and tend to blow things all out of proportion.

That should get you through.",2,capricorn,2018

In the evening, plan an intimate celebration!",2,capricorn,2018
17,"Minor difficulties over money could put you in a state of frustration. The problems aren’t Earthshaking, but they still need to be handled and could take up a lot of time that you’d rather spend doing something else. Giving in to your frustration could waste more time than simply handling the situation and moving on, however. Try to keep your cool, Capricorn. Take your problems in both hands, resolve them, and move on.",2,capricorn,2018
18,"Some wonderful news concerning money and career matters could come your way today, Capricorn. Your natural kindness and sympathy for others has led you to make some good friends who are also valuable business contacts. This is definitely paying off.

19,"Someone you work with might need a sympathetic shoulder to cry on today, Capricorn. Stresses on the job extend beyond everyone's capacity to endure, so don't be surprised if at some point a colleague sheds a few tears. You might find your patience pushed beyond its normal limits. On days like this it's best to work as quickly as you can, stay focused, and go for a drink after you leave work. Then have a nice walk home!",2,capricorn,2018
20,"Financial considerations could delay the start of a new project that you’ve wanted to begin for a long time, Capricorn. Perhaps you don't quite have the funds you need, or maybe the cost is a bit higher than you expected. Don't sink into despair. This is only another temporary delay. Tighten the budget and make substitutions. Use your innate ingenuity to work around it and the project should be right on schedule.",2,capricorn,2018
21,"This definitely isn’t a good day to stay home and do household chores, Capricorn. If you do, some sad and rather irrational thoughts may plague you throughout the day. No matter what the weather's like, it would be far better to get out and do anything that keeps your mind focused on something positive. Go shopping, attend a sports event, see a movie, or visit a friend. Whatever you do, get your mind off yourself. Go enjoy your day.",2,capricorn,2018
22,"Today, or rather tonight, is for romance and cozy intimacy, Capricorn. You pull out all the stops for your evening with that special someone. Scented candles, your best perfume, and your most sensuous clothing work to enchant the person who is already head over heels in love with you. Your relationship is clicking along just beautifully right now. Why not celebrate in some special way?",2,capricorn,2018
23,"Change, even when it's for the better, can sometimes be a little scary, Capricorn. You could feel some hesitation about taking a new job or upgrading your home.

Tomorrow you'll probably look as terrific as ever. Hang in there.",2,capricorn,2018
25,"A new relationship is likely to form soon, and it will probably be with someone who’s already in your life.

Romance is definitely in the air today, Capricorn, so keep your eyes open for subtle cues from the people in your life.",2,capricorn,2018
26,"Colleagues may be a bit on edge, Capricorn. You'll have to choose your words carefully. If you feel as though you’re walking on eggshells, you are. There’s definite tension in the air. And while you can't identify the source, you can certainly see it manifested on the faces of your co-workers. Today wouldn’t be a good day to offer constructive criticism of any kind. Don't rock the boat.",2,capricorn,2018
27,"In an unpleasant situation, your inclination is to protect your loved ones from the truth. This would be a mistake, Capricorn. Even though you're acting out of love, your family members deserve to know the truth even if it hurts. You can't shield them from the realities of the outside world. Most people, even the young, prefer to know the facts.",2,capricorn,2018
28,"You could soon receive news of an unexpected cash inflow, Capricorn. This might be money earned on your own, but it's more likely to be investment income. If you own stocks, bonds, or land, expect their value to skyrocket. If you work for a company that has a good profit-sharing plan, don't be surprised if the amount of profits earned this year doubles. Whichever it is, you're on your way!",2,capricorn,2018
1,"You can't help but feel a bit frustrated today, Capricorn. There are places to go, people to see, and you can't seem to get out of the house. Your responsibilities are at home now, and the situation won't change for a while. You can, however, plan some mini-vacations without too much effort. Treat yourself one evening to fantastic take-out food and a sappy old movie. That might be just the thing to lift your spirits.",3,capricorn,2018
2,"Setbacks on the job might have you a little depressed and worried. Don't worry, Capricorn; all will be well. Think of this as a challenge to overcome. Your natural practicality and efficiency will see you through. Someone isn't being totally honest with you. Encourage people around you to open up and communicate a little. What they say may not be all that agreeable, but at least you'll be better able to assess the situation.",3,capricorn,2018
3,"The information coming at you today may be clouded and delusional, Capricorn. Take it with a grain of salt. Someone could try to pull the wool over your eyes. Check the bus schedule twice before hopping on board. You could find yourself lost in the wrong part of town otherwise. Have patience and try not to get too upset if you aren't receiving the answers you want. The truth will come out soon enough.",3,capricorn,2018
4,"The energy that has propelled you forward for the past several weeks might seem to lag a bit today, causing you momentary panic that your progress won't continue. As a result, you could be feeling a bit blue. Don't fall into this trap, Capricorn. The pace has been so fast that it had to slow down sometime. It will pick up again, and you'll have had time to catch your breath. Hang in there!",3,capricorn,2018
5,"A lot of effort, energy, and enthusiasm that you've put into various business or personal projects in the past could finally pay off today.

Go out and celebrate tonight!",3,capricorn,2018
6,"Be more adventurous than usual, Capricorn. Feel free to take a trip somewhere without bringing a map or having any specific destination in mind. The sheer excitement of the unknown should thrill and enthuse you, not frighten and confuse. Your enjoyment of the situation has to do with your attitude toward it. You may not be able to control the hand you're dealt, but you can certainly control how you play it.",3,capricorn,2018
7,"Your sensual nature is heightened, Capricorn, and you'll find yourself engaged in tender moments and languid peacefulness in the company of others. Soothe your soul by letting yourself slip into situations that give you the emotional freedom to do or say whatever comes to mind. Life should be like a love poem written by a great master. Accept the good energy that comes your way.",3,capricorn,2018
8,"You could feel like you're walking a puppy that won't heel, Capricorn. The puppy is curious and, at times, rather reckless. It doesn't know about the dangers of cars or a twisted leash. You have a great responsibility to teach this dog some lesson, while at the same time giving it a bit of freedom to go out and explore alone. Earn the respect of others by tempering discipline with fun.",3,capricorn,2018
9,"While you are Earthy by nature and enjoy physical passion, Capricorn, this might seem even more pronounced today. Racy novels and movies could be especially appealing. You may want to plan a romantic evening with a lover. If you don't have one, don't be surprised if an old friend suddenly looks very sexy! This is a great day to shop for clothes. You're more likely to pick the most becoming items.",3,capricorn,2018
10,"Today is a very high-energy day in which you have the physical stamina to accomplish quite a bit, Capricorn. Take care, however, that you have all the necessary facts before you venture out for your day's activities. It could be that there is a hidden force working, perhaps within your own mind, to blur the lines of reality about a certain issue. Check your sources and proceed with caution.",3,capricorn,2018
11,"Your energy is likely to operate in extreme bursts, Capricorn. One minute you may be lethargic and the next you're ready to run a marathon. Engage in activities that nurture your fluctuating moods. There's no need to figure out why you feel this way. The key is to identify these feelings and act accordingly. Plan how you want to use your energy when it does come. Misdirected action may prove harmful.",3,capricorn,2018

13,"Be careful of getting into fights today, Capricorn. However, if a squabble or altercation of some sort seems inevitable, don't shrink away and hide. It's important that you face the source of the attack and stand up to whomever or whatever is getting in your path. Conjure up the warrior inside you and you might surprise yourself with the incredible power you have within.",3,capricorn,2018
14,"Vivid, wonderful dreams may have haunted your sleep last night, Capricorn, leaving you disappointed that they weren't real. They have a message for you, so write them down, set them aside, and analyze them later. Your psychic abilities and imagination are very sharp today. This is a great day to start an artistic project that has been in the back of your mind for some time. Enjoy your day.",3,capricorn,2018
15,"Emotions will run high with today's planetary energies, Capricorn. But this is no reason to run away and hide! People will be much more honest than usual, even brutally so, and you could learn some valuable information as a result. Don't be afraid to listen to some airing of dirty laundry as well. With your discerning judgment, you'll be able to make sense of what is good information and what isn't.",3,capricorn,2018
16,"Although it looks as if the next few months should shape up to be a great time for your career, Capricorn, unfortunately, today it might appear hopeless. Mundane, routine, unrewarding tasks could take up a lot of your time on the job today. Nevertheless, don't let the frustration interfere with your outlook for the future. You're due for advancement in some way!",3,capricorn,2018
17,"You may find that your heart is bouncing back and forth like a tennis ball today, Capricorn. One minute you could be drawn one way, while the next minute you're drawn in a completely different direction. Instead of trying to fight this feeling, take advantage of it. Consciously or unconsciously, what you're really doing is exploring. Try new things until you're sure that you've found what you need.",3,capricorn,2018
18,"Travel that is possibly related to business could come up for you, Capricorn. A friend or colleague may accompany you. Expect the unexpected where your career is concerned.

19,"You might feel as if your heart is playing tricks on you today, Capricorn. Perhaps you're coming up against a strong force that's causing you to doubt yourself in some way. Don't be conned by loud, obnoxious talk. Seek the true meaning behind the words. You'll find that most of your strength is internal. Be prepared for stubborn wills to make a powerful presence in your world today.",3,capricorn,2018
20,"Too much stress and strain over the past few days could cause you to clash with your partner. While not a disaster by any means, Capricorn, this can put a damper on your day. It might be best if you took a few minutes to get away by yourself and let all your negativity fade away when no one's around. You'll feel better by the time you face your family, friends, and partner again.",3,capricorn,2018
21,"It may not be easy for you to convince someone today. No matter how profound your idea or how convincing your explanations, the other person just isn't ready to believe it yet. Don't be pushy. Maybe this person needs to sleep on it for a couple of nights, or maybe they just need to do their own research. Be patient and focus on other things in the meantime!",3,capricorn,2018
22,"You could feel a lot of fond affection for everyone around you today, even those you normally might find irritating. Co-workers, friends, family, and the special person in your life are likely to be happier for having basked in this glow, and should reciprocate. You're feeling especially generous, Capricorn, so buying gifts is likely to be on your agenda. Don't forget to be kind to yourself, too.",3,capricorn,2018
23,"Studying in solitude may appeal to you today, Capricorn. A new interest has captured your imagination, so you may decide to sequester yourself at home or in the library to learn about it. Your concentration is high, as is your perseverance, so anything you begin today is likely to succeed. The downside is that you might strain your eyes or give yourself headaches trying to accomplish too much at once. Pace yourself.",3,capricorn,2018
24,"Do you like detective stories, Capricorn? If so, you may find them useful today as you play the role of Sherlock Holmes. A missing object, intellectual problem, or mystery of some kind could have you curious enough to search for the truth. This is a good way to train your powers of observation, although intuition will probably play a strong role in your success. Go to it, and have fun!",3,capricorn,2018
25,"Communication with partners is likely to be poor to nonexistent today, Capricorn. This isn't the time to enter into contract negotiations or other discussions that could affect your future in a major way. The prevailing mood is down, so whatever you decide today is apt to reflect that mood. It might be best to wait a few days until everyone is in a more positive frame of mind. Hang in there!",3,capricorn,2018
26,"Dreams or visions could bring sudden and exciting insights with regard to career issues, Capricorn. These dreams could steer you toward books, websites, and other sources of information that can provide further guidance that could well prove invaluable. The source of your insights may be rather unorthodox, but don't write them off because of that. Think of them as messages from your higher self and make the most of them.",3,capricorn,2018
27,"This may be a tricky day, Capricorn, as you feel the pull of conflicting demands and desires. On the one hand, you feel obligated to your career and fulfilling the demands of your employer.

Go to it!",3,capricorn,2018
30,"If you're involved in the arts, Capricorn, expect today to hear about an opportunity to exhibit your work publicly. There should be a very positive reaction to it, so you can expect a lot of compliments and ego-boosts. An opportunity to earn some money from your work could also come along. Don't turn it down out of shyness or insecurity. Go for the gold. This trend is likely to continue, so make the most of it.",3,capricorn,2018
31,"Idealized romantic feelings could pour out today when talking to your love interest, Capricorn. That's fine, but you should exercise restraint. If it's a new relationship, your partner could be scared off. If it's a long-term involvement, your friend might feel at a disadvantage. Channel the feelings into a poem, song, or painting. If you must voice them directly to your friend, keep the terms general. Don't put your beloved on the spot.",3,capricorn,2018
1,"Money matters could have you descending into a state of pure gloom, Capricorn. On the surface it might seem like you'll never be able to sort through all the paperwork, but you will.

Cheer up, and plan a great evening!",4,capricorn,2018
2,"Your thinking is solid and clear today, Capricorn, but other people could challenge your mental power. Don't let others put seeds of doubt in your head about the way you approach a problem. Keep your mind open to alternative solutions, but don't beat yourself up for your current mental track. You might need to modify your strategy, but don't sacrifice your principles or values.",4,capricorn,2018
3,"You could hesitate to take the initiative, Capricorn. Instead, you'd rather wait and see how things pan out before you make a major move. Your movements are hindered in some way, although you may not be sure why. It's best to go with your intuition and not question too much. Just know that you're better off taking the safer route rather than walking too far out on the thin ice.",4,capricorn,2018
4,"Although you generally like to keep both feet on the ground and proceed in a stable, organized manner, Capricorn, there's a strong force encouraging you to spread your wings.

This will bring a greater sense of balance to your life.",4,capricorn,2018
5,"This is a day to think about your private life, Capricorn. Expect to be particularly sensitive to all kinds of demands from those close to you.

8,"You always tend to have good powers of concentration, Capricorn, but today you're more focused than usual, probably on a project that means a lot to you.

The downside is that you might forget to eat, sleep, or take any breaks. Take care!",4,capricorn,2018
9,"A strong desire to meet with a romantic partner could come over you today, Capricorn. However, you might not be able to reach your friend. He or she could be busy and unable to respond to phone messages or emails. Nonetheless, don't get too frustrated. If you persist, the two of you will eventually touch base. If you can't see each other today, make arrangements for tomorrow. Better late than never!",4,capricorn,2018
10,"You might have planned to make a particular purchase today, Capricorn, but a quick check of your financial situation could reveal that it would be better if you waited until your next payday. This could prove disappointing and frustrating, but look at it this way - you've waited this long for this item. It isn't urgent, so waiting a little longer certainly won't hurt. Do something else today.",4,capricorn,2018
11,"Your outlook is apt to be optimistic, enthusiastic, and practical, Capricorn! You have both creative and workable ideas. They're likely to lead to success, although it could take considerable time and effort to make it happen. Communication with colleagues is likely to be open, honest, and very dynamic as projects and enterprises take on a life of their own. Work hard, make it happen, and enjoy the journey!",4,capricorn,2018
12,"Career matters couldn't be going better right now, Capricorn, especially if you're in one of the communication fields, including writing, publishing, teaching, the Internet, or mass media. Your financial situation is probably improving very quickly, and you're making contact with congenial, intriguing people who share your interests. You're also becoming more aware of the changes going on in the world and doing your part to help them along. Bravo!",4,capricorn,2018
13,"This could be a day of inner turmoil, Capricorn. You'll rethink some of your fundamental values, unsure if they're still relevant to your life. It's clear that some soul searching is needed.

Think things through before taking steps.",4,capricorn,2018
14,"A lack of communication on the part of your mate or perhaps a business partner can cause you to feel uncertainty about the relationship. Don't fall into this trap, Capricorn.

17,"You can overcome the intensity of today's planetary energies by making a conscious effort stay positive, Capricorn. Distract yourself with necessary household chores and errands. Don't forget to take some time out for fun, too. As you work around the house, stop to indulge yourself every few hours. A cup of hot chocolate or a chat on the phone will add a welcome grace note to the day.",4,capricorn,2018
18,"You're eager and optimistic today, Capricorn, which works well with your strong, capable nature. You're likely to find that things begin to click into place at work.

As long as you feel appreciated, you're happy to go the extra mile (or two). You can expect to feel loved by those around you. You have a willing, giving nature, and it shows in your aura like a beacon for all to see.",4,capricorn,2018
20,"Use the power of words as an artistic medium to express yourself, Capricorn. You have a magic way with words that often goes unrecognized. Your sensual nature is poetic. You shouldn't deprive others of this talent, so show it off to the world. Perhaps you're moved to write a love poem to a partner who means a great deal to you. As trite as this may sound, it's actually very romantic.",4,capricorn,2018
21,"Communication could take some extra effort today, Capricorn. A business or romantic partner could seem like they're keeping things from you.

22,"Financial good fortune continues, Capricorn, although old habits are hard to break and you might have difficulty adjusting to it.

28,"Some underhanded and not altogether honest machinations could be happening at the workplace, Capricorn. You could be offended by it, and you could also worry if it threatens your job.

Go with the flow and all should be completed successfully. Onward and upward!",4,capricorn,2018
30,"A subject you're researching, perhaps for a class or workshop, might prove more difficult than you expected, Capricorn. The resources you consult might be very scholarly and thus difficult to read. If you can't find anything comprehensible, try to rent or buy a video on the subject. It's more important to understand the material than force yourself to approach it in the accepted scholarly manner. It's also important that you enjoy it.",4,capricorn,2018
1,"Today's energy will be making you think only about your relationships, Capricorn. It isn't easy to have relationships with others, as you may have noticed.

2,"Are you having some problems with authority, Capricorn? Are you having a hard time making yourself understood?

People will be adamant and strong willed when it comes to their facts. You should be, too.",5,capricorn,2018
4,"You might be upset by certain financial matters today, Capricorn. Either you realize just how much you've been spending lately or you see that things will be tight in the months ahead.

9,"You just can't do everything at once, Capricorn. How do you expect to reduce your stress and recuperate while at the same time continue to be a superstar performer in every area of your life?

10,"You're well aware that your happiness in love doesn't depend on emotional promises alone. In order to attract your attention, anyone new in your life has to make some material offering as well.

People are finally beginning to catch on.",5,capricorn,2018

Be prepared to tackle a crisis or two, Capricorn!",5,capricorn,2018
12,"Be disciplined about all areas of your body, Capricorn. Take extra care to eat healthful, balanced meals. Make sure you get enough sleep.

Your health is essential to your well-being, not to mention your life!",5,capricorn,2018
13,"Contact with friends who live or work far away could bring a string of new opportunities your way. You might also be thinking of taking a trip, perhaps to another country or by boat.

What happens today could be too important to let your mind become muddled.",5,capricorn,2018
14,"This is a good day to devote time and thought to spiritual pursuits, Capricorn. Do something inspirational that instills a sense of wonder deep in your soul.

15,"Something has to change, Capricorn. You knew it as soon as you woke up this morning. Your mirror provides the impetus for some important resolutions. Is it time to begin a diet, make a commitment to exercise more, or strengthen your resolve to quit smoking? Anything you do to improve your health will make you feel better about yourself.

19,"Enough of thinking about yourself, Capricorn! The hour has now arrived to draw some conclusions. You're at the end of the lengthy volume you were writing on your inner life. You'll have to integrate what you've learned with the different emotions and situations that you're in now. ""Normalization"" will be the key word in the days to come.",5,capricorn,2018
20,"Things will go more and more in your favor over the next four weeks, Capricorn, although today you might find that they're slow to get moving. It could be that there is a bit of stress on your body and that you aren't feeling very motivated to get up and go. Don't worry about it. This feeling will soon pass and you'll feel like your old self in no time.",5,capricorn,2018
21,"Combine today's grounding force with a bit of emotional intensity from your heart to create a powerful combination of spirit that will surely make an impact on whatever you contact, Capricorn.

1,"Your sense of self may be a bit challenged today, Capricorn. You might just have trouble getting out of bed at all.

You might also want to fix yourself up and plan a romantic evening!",7,capricorn,2018
17,"This kind of strange day doesn't occur often, Capricorn. You no longer seem to know what you want. Work or time off? Redecorate your house or live in a beach shack?

12,"Your heart's in the right place today, but somehow you find it hard to execute the things you want to do. Art and music projects are especially difficult for you now. They require a more cerebral approach than you'd like to admit. Perhaps you're drawn to the spiritual nature of things more than you're opposed to the rational nature of things.",11,aquarius,2017
13,"Your mind could be of service to others today. You've been doing very well for yourself, and you're thinking in terms of sharing your good fortune somehow. A friend may have ideas for groups that you could get involved with. Before you commit to anything, make sure you really want to do it. You don't want to be entrusted with a cause and then let others down.",11,aquarius,2017
14,"You're trying to protect and shelter a certain part of yourself from others. This special spot in your soul that you hide from others is probably the most beautiful, since you nurture it so carefully. Don't give up this piece of yourself too easily. Save this pristine, delicate place for someone most deserving.",11,aquarius,2017
15,"Your masculine and feminine sides may be saying completely different things today, but this situation isn't necessarily bad. You can learn a lot from both sides of your being. Take the most useful aspects of each and put them toward achieving your goals. A delicate balance of give and take needs to happen.",11,aquarius,2017
16,"It may seem like everything is moving counter to your trajectory. While you want to move south, the wind blows west. This doesn't mean you should give up on your goal. This just means that you may need to tack in order to get where you're going. A sideways approach is just the thing needed in order to get to your paradise.",11,aquarius,2017
17,"You should feel especially romantic and sexy today. Tonight should be wonderful if you can spend it in the company of your significant other. Some vivid dreams could haunt your sleep tonight, almost to the point where you don't want to wake up. Write them down and try to figure out what they mean later.",11,aquarius,2017
18,"Sudden, unexpected success could result in an equally unexpected raise. Friends may have pointed you in the direction that put you in the right place at the right time. Don't be surprised if this catapults you into entirely different life circumstances. Make the most of this break. Don't rest on your laurels or your success could disappear as fast as it came.",11,aquarius,2017
19,"A social event today could put you in contact with some old friends who mean a great deal to you. The occasion will be very warm and friendly, though you may feel a little subdued. Never mind! Sometimes companionable silence is preferable to forced talk. Just bask in the presence of cherished companions and listen to what others say. You'll enjoy yourself that much more.",11,aquarius,2017
20,"Recognition could finally come for hard work and goals reached. You're feeling very good about the situation. Your self-confidence and mental strength are high. You'll receive a lot of letters or calls, some from far away. Don't be surprised if you spend most of the day talking.",11,aquarius,2017
21,"Love may become more sensual. You should consider new ways in which to pamper your special someone. There may be gossip associated with your relationship that turns you off at first, but don't let that get in the way of expressing your true feelings. Real communication about this partnership will be primarily nonverbal.",11,aquarius,2017
22,A new unity and purpose could create a more positive atmosphere regarding your career. Recognition and an increased income are just over the horizon. Don't be surprised if changes lie in store. You could end up in an entirely different profession! The support and affection of friends can see you through the transition.,11,aquarius,2017
23,"An unwitting communication from a friend could set you off on a path that changes your life. This could involve business opportunities, or you could discover a new interest or group you'd like to join. Whatever it is, it may capture your attention and keep your energies focused for a long time. This should be a positive development.",11,aquarius,2017
24,You're a sensual person. You have a strong emotional force. Today that energy will increase and express itself vigorously. The people you encounter will be astonished by your power. You could easily seduce the entire world. Try to keep this energy under control. You could be thrown off balance and into a situation you might regret.,11,aquarius,2017
25,"If you had to take a test today and had a choice between poetry and physics, you wouldn't hesitate. Poetry. Today is about interpretation, not analysis. A change in the atmosphere over the next few days is going to affect your thinking. You should expect some confusion in your contact with the people closest to you.",11,aquarius,2017
26,"Answer your phone and open all mail today, because money may come your way from an unexpected source. This could be a real windfall that utterly changes your life. With this money you could start a business or give your family some advantages you never dreamed you could afford. It's bound to be a great day.",11,aquarius,2017
27,"Your significant other may be expected at your house tonight but not show up, and may not even communicate with you. This might cause you to be understandably worried. Don't make yourself crazy. All signs are that your partner is OK. Traffic is the likeliest culprit keeping the two of you apart. Your friend may show up a lot later than expected.",11,aquarius,2017
28,"Looking good is the best revenge. If you're trying to get over a failed relationship, the best way to pull yourself out of a depression is to look your very best. Get up early and go for a run or an exercise class. Buy some new clothes and take extra care with your grooming. You'll lift your spirits and attract a new, more fitting partner.",11,aquarius,2017
29,"Confusion may reign today, particularly if you're intuitive. You may pick up strange vibes that could be unsettling. Don't try to make sense of them. Your ESP may be a bit off, or those people whose feelings you're sensing are stressed and lacking direction. Or it could be both. Either way, you should be back to normal tomorrow.",11,aquarius,2017
30,"Just because you're stressed now doesn't mean that you need to be stressed tomorrow, or the rest of the day for that matter. There are steps you can take to soothe your troubled soul. Stop, close your eyes, and relax into some deep breaths. You'll be surprised by how refreshing these few moments can be. Why not try it?",11,aquarius,2017
1,"Today will be lighthearted - and just in time, too. Life was getting serious there for a while. Smile and try to go outside your normal routine. What's the point of working so hard if you only reward yourself by slumping in a chair at home? Go for a ride in the country for an hour or two instead. It would do you good.",12,aquarius,2017
2,"You may run up against a brick wall early today. Things should ease a bit by evening. Remember that the harder you push against that wall, the more your head will pound, the more bruised your shoulder will become, and the more energy you'll expend. You'll be surprised at how easy things get when you step back. You'll see that you can go around the wall without charging through it.",12,aquarius,2017
3,"There's a terrific, warm, and nurturing quality to the day. The people around you are validating your inner and outer aspects. Emotions could get intense, but your grounded perspective helps you see through the situation. Spend time cooking up a great meal for those you love. If you don't feel like cooking, splurge on a good meal at your favorite restaurant.",12,aquarius,2017
4,"Information regarding spiritual or philosophical matters that may not be all that trustworthy may come your way. Don't take what you hear today at face value. A close friend or lover may be far away, and you could feel lonely. The best way to get through the separation is to keep busy, perhaps with study, research, or artistic activities.",12,aquarius,2017
5,"Today you might try to secure the perfect job, possibly in an artistic field or one connected with the healing arts. You might have a specific position in mind, or you could consider several. It's important to think of all the ins and outs of every position before charging ahead. What you think might be perfect today could have hidden aspects you don't know about.",12,aquarius,2017
6,"Your energy and enthusiasm are at an all-time high. Your life, business, and money matters are going very well, and there are no signs that this will change any time soon. Romance should also be going very well. This should be doing wonders for your self-image. Whatever you've been doing, keep it up! You've got a lot to look forward to.",12,aquarius,2017
7,"You may feel like a scatterbrain when you forget where you put your keys and put detergent in the dryer with your freshly washed clothes. Your brain is tossed every which way, and it may be hard to follow through on anything you start. Don't get too hung up on this. Go with the flow without trying to force yourself into anything that doesn't come naturally.",12,aquarius,2017
8,"This will be one of those days when you're glad to get up. The energy is exceptionally positive. You'll probably feel energetic, confident, and ready to get down to work on your projects. This in combination with your tendency to work hard can have you going strong. Don't overdo it. Take some time to smell the roses and take a little rest.",12,aquarius,2017
9,"You may experience a bit of tension and resistance with someone during the early part of the day, but things will ease as evening draws near. People will be more flexible as the day wears on, and be more receptive to your perspective. The more organized and grounded you are, the more room there is for expansion and growth in all the different parts of your world.",12,aquarius,2017
10,This is a good day to keep a low profile. Any attention that comes your way today is suspect. Don't trust the motives of anyone who asks too many questions or who seems too interested in anything you're doing. This isn't a good day to start new projects or move forward with any new acquaintances. Lose yourself in the pursuit of your own interests.,12,aquarius,2017
11,"Take advantage of today to spend quality time in the cozy little nest you and your family enjoy so much. It's a happy, home-sweet-home kind of day. A healthy, peaceful atmosphere reigns and dispels domestic tensions. Seize the opportunity to recharge your batteries. Tomorrow you'll need plenty of energy.",12,aquarius,2017
12,"Devote your energies to human psychology today. It's a good day to try to sell your ideas. Concentrate your efforts on those whose help you need. If you have faith in your originality, your sales efforts are likely to pay off. In fact, there is some chance you'll meet an especially dynamic person who can lead you into some fascinating, unexplored territory.",12,aquarius,2017
13,"There's some likelihood that your emotions have changed in the past six weeks or so. You're no longer attracted to the same people. You're unsure of yourself at work, and you even wonder if your attractiveness had deserted you. Beginning today, these doubts will be dispelled. Take heart.",12,aquarius,2017
14,"Discussions about religion could come up during your day. A recent rush of intuitive revelations could cause you to want to expound on your beliefs, but this could backfire. This isn't the day to try to convince others of anything. This also isn't a good day to think in terms of getting away for a while. Kick around a few ideas, but make definite plans later.",12,aquarius,2017
15,"A member of your group may have gone away without telling anyone where he or she was going. This could be worrisome for the rest of you, but don't fret. Your friend is probably OK, but may just need to do some thinking alone. You have to accept that you won't hear from this person today. Have faith and don't worry.",12,aquarius,2017
16,"All indications are that you're feeling mentally and physically great. Your professional and financial interests could take a sudden turn for the better. Love matters should also be going well, and children bring great pleasure today. This is a good time to make plans for the future and pursue your most cherished ambitions.",12,aquarius,2017
17,This is a great day to shop. Join friends and hit the stores to add more beauty and pleasurable items to your life. Stay away from the cheap and shoddy. You deserve quality. Turn the expedition into a social event and have fun. You'll have a great time with your friends even if you don't buy anything.,12,aquarius,2017
18,Point your aggressiveness in the right direction today. That shouldn't be too hard since you know and understand the meaning of a job well done and what's required to get things accomplished. You're anxious to get the ball rolling on certain projects. You've done the organization and planning. Trust that you know exactly how to proceed.,12,aquarius,2017
19,"There's a fast-paced frenzy to the day that might leave you feeling a bit left out. You may want to take things more slowly, yet the day's energy doesn't allow for hesitation or delay. This is a good time to get out and be social. Make important contacts with others and try to multitask. Keep your humor handy and your manner flexible.",12,aquarius,2017
20,This is a terrific day for you. Not only are your emotions at a cyclical peak but they also have added strength that will help you stay courageous in the face of any opposition that comes your way. The good news is that your planning may pay off. There are strong forces at work helping you to make progress toward your goals.,12,aquarius,2017
21,"Things may be happening all around you today. You could feel like a spectator watching a foreign theater production. Don't sit this one out in the audience. In fact, your energy is needed on center stage. Balance out the crazy drama with a bit of your solid, powerful rationality.",12,aquarius,2017
22,"Is this the day you'll meet someone new? It's possible! The astral aspects are going to make it a lot easier for you. Given the wonderful energy you have at the moment, someone fascinating may be attracted to you. Take advantage of this wonderful day. It's tailor made for you!",12,aquarius,2017
23,"Today is about reevaluation. Dreams or ambitions that you may have abandoned could resurface. You could be forced to confront difficulties in your current situation. You might decide to call in a few favors from people you haven't heard from in ages. Old debts may need repaying. This is a great time to tie up loose ends, attain closure, and move on.",12,aquarius,2017
24,"You're in the home stretch now. Kiss your worries goodbye. Your efforts pay off as people listen to your advice and try to please you. Although certain details in your love life still need to be worked out, it's safe to coast for a while. You've spent months in this process of self-transformation and you deserve a little rest.",12,aquarius,2017
25,"Your emotions may feel restricted today, but this could be for the best. Try to take a lighthearted approach to the situation, and don't get too serious about anything. The more flexible your attitude, the better off you'll be. Keep your feelings under control by not reading too deeply into the subtleties of things.",12,aquarius,2017
26,"You can be a little stubborn, and it seems that you're in the process of giving a wonderful demonstration of this. You can be a little slow when you need to move, but once you get started, it's very hard to get you to stop! Still, there's nothing terribly difficult about making the necessary adjustments. You need to give yourself time.",12,aquarius,2017
27,"A certain decision means that you've reached a turning point. The hardest part about making this decision is saying farewell to your old ways. The past can seem cozy and reassuring, especially when the unknown looms. It takes strength and determination to leave it behind. But whether it's your career or your love life, you have personal goals that can't be sacrificed or denied.",12,aquarius,2017
28,"You might not feel especially motivated today. Nonetheless, whether you want to or not, it's important that you attack the mountain of tasks. Understand and respect the constraints of the ticking clock. As long as you're disciplined about accomplishing one small task at a time, you won't have a problem reducing the mountain to a small pile.",12,aquarius,2017
29,"Your biorhythms may be low today, so you might not be feeling quite up to par. This could make you feel restless and a little blue. Most likely your malaise is related to stress. Play some soft music. Surround yourself with flowers or other colorful objects. If possible, get a massage. This will help you relax. You'll feel like your old self by tomorrow.",12,aquarius,2017
30,"It may feel like something has suddenly clicked into place for you today in which you have found the missing piece of a puzzle you've been working on for a while, Aquarius. The answers may be subtle, but they are there. Fantasy and a playful attitude will lead you to them effortlessly. Spread your ideas out to the world today and adopt an attitude that encourages others to join in your daydreams as well.",12,aquarius,2017
31,"Today you might realize that you need to make a certain purchase, Aquarius. Perhaps your home or car requires some important repairs, or maybe some new equipment is necessary for your work. This could prove rather disheartening, as it might involve spending money that you'd rather use for something more exciting. Think of the trouble this expenditure should save you, however, and you'll see the value of it all.",12,aquarius,2017
1,"Plans for a party or group gathering of some kind could take up much of your time and energy, Aquarius. You might have a lot of letters to write, phone calls to make, or other communications to take care of, but this is likely to prove to be a great excuse for getting in touch with your friends. Today could prove to be a kind of party-before-the-party, which is right up your alley. Enjoy your day!",1,aquarius,2018
2,"You have a keen mind, Aquarius, and are always absorbing new bits of information. What is amazing is how much of it you manage to retain. Today, however, even your considerable brain may be taxed beyond its limits. At work you may feel overwhelmed by the mass of information to sort through. At home there may be books and magazines piled up that you're anxious to read. Consider taking the evening off from intellectual pursuits. There is something to be said for passive entertainment.",1,aquarius,2018
3,"Today you'll likely awake, look around your home environment, and realize that there is much room for improvement. Fortunately, you are just the person for the job, Aquarius! You are creative and have tremendous decorating talent (even if you don't realize it). Since it's likely that you will have some visitors this evening, why not spend the day reorganizing and sprucing up your home. Add homey touches with groupings of framed family photographs on one table and a favorite collection on another. It doesn't take money to make a home feel welcoming, just love.",1,aquarius,2018
4,"Today, you crave a little style. Sensible shoes and practical clothes get the boot in favor of fashionable shoes and luxurious fabrics. Your passion and sense of romance are at an all-time high, Aquarius, so you might as well take advantage of it for all it's worth. You can expect to reap a tremendous payoff as a result of the extra efforts you have been making with your appearance.",1,aquarius,2018
5,"A close friend or love partner you haven't seen for a while could finally make arrangements to see you, Aquarius. You therefore could spend much of the day in a great mood, looking forward to the encounter ahead. You'll have a lot of fascinating information to share. It might be a good idea, however, to cut your visit a little shorter than you'd like and make arrangements for another meeting. Otherwise, you might get too tired.",1,aquarius,2018
6,"You might be feeling especially adventurous today, Aquarius. The same old streets and buildings in the same old town might suddenly seem to be closing in on you. Therefore, you might just grab a close friend or significant other, hop in the car, and take off for the mountains or the ocean. You probably need a break. You've been working very hard and probably could benefit from some time in open country. Go for it!",1,aquarius,2018
7,"There's no question, this has been a long time coming. But today the change you have been hoping for so long is likely to occur, Aquarius. The enormity of the change may not be obvious, at least at first. But over time, you will look back on the events of today and see just how pivotal they were. Keep your wits about you today, and seize any intriguing opportunity that comes along.",1,aquarius,2018
8,"Excesses in food and drink yesterday may force you to cancel a social engagement today, Aquarius. You probably aren't feeling up to it. This might be a bit irritating, and somewhat embarrassing as well. However, you just might have needed the rest even if you hadn't eaten too much. Make the most of your evening alone. Soak in a tub and go to bed early. In the morning, you'll be glad you did.",1,aquarius,2018
9,"Think of yourself as a marathon runner. You have a very long distance to travel, but the sweetness is not just to be found in crossing the finish line, but rather in relishing all the sights along the way. While your head today is overflowing with plans and ideas, you begin to feel deflated when you begin to consider all the logistics of realizing these dreams. Fret not, Aquarius. The planets have blessed you with an energy level that is equal to the task, so go ahead and get started!",1,aquarius,2018
10,"If you're involved in a creative project, Aquarius, your imagination might seem to have deserted you. You might rack your brain trying to think up new ideas but draw a blank every time. Perhaps this isn't the best day to work on your project. Sometimes we need a break from our work to maintain the quality of it. Do something else for today. Tomorrow you'll be back to normal.",1,aquarius,2018
11,"Are you in an especially adventurous mood, Aquarius? This is the sort of day when you can try just about anything new and still come out in one piece. Why not enroll in a marathon, take rock-climbing lessons, or drive to a place you've never been to before? Wherever you end up, you should find peace and a heightened state of awareness. Don't hesitate. If what you have in mind involves minimal risk, go for it!",1,aquarius,2018
12,"Aquarius, visitors in your home might include partners in business activities, members of a group with which you're affiliated, or creative people with great ideas. Therefore, you're likely to enjoy some intense discussions today and a lot of intriguing exchanges of information. Love and romance should also go well, particularly since you're feeling so enthusiastic about life. Take the time to share your dreams with your guests. They might have some good ideas for making a dream a reality.",1,aquarius,2018
13,"Have you just recently reached a cherished goal, Aquarius? If so, you might temporarily be confused as to what you're going to pursue in the future. You may be toying with a number of options but not be sure which one is right for you. Perhaps it's none of them. Maybe your perfect goal is still over the horizon. Don't feel you have to get started on something right away. Be patient and have faith.",1,aquarius,2018
14,"The opportunity to make a change in your life, which you may have been contemplating for a long time, could finally manifest itself today, Aquarius. This could be a move to a new neighborhood, a return to school for an advanced degree, an entirely new profession, or all of the above. Whichever it is, expect to spend a lot of time throughout the day discussing it with friends and family. Then move ahead with whatever plans you have.",1,aquarius,2018
15,"A project initiated by a group with which you're affiliated could keep you very busy today, Aquarius. You might have to spend a lot of time on the phone or running around in the car to libraries and bookstores obtaining information. A close friend or love partner might choose to accompany you. You're likely to be feeling very strongly about whatever you're doing, so expect a gratifying day. Spend the evening with someone close to you.",1,aquarius,2018
16,"Something may be troubling a family member, Aquarius, and this person doesn't seem inclined to talk about it. Your intuition seems to be temporarily blocked, so you can't figure it out for yourself. Don't try; it's probably buried too deeply within the other person. Make it clear that you're there if needed and then allow this person to go his or her own way. Don't let this situation cause you to doubt their need and respect for you.",1,aquarius,2018
17,"You may have been especially interested in promoting your general health for a while, Aquarius, and so today you could finally start that nutrition and exercise program you've been thinking about. You're likely to come up with a plan that is more than workable since your thinking is especially clear and logical right now. Others might be inspired to join you. Whatever work you do should be accomplished quickly and skillfully. Use your energy to get as much done as possible.",1,aquarius,2018
18,"Today you could enter a new romantic relationship, Aquarius, or you could experience a new sense of unity and commitment within an existing one. Whichever it is, the relationship might become very intense, so be sure that you and your partner make the effort to give each other plenty of space. Powerful bonds can lead to great strength as a couple, but they can also bind and constrict if each party isn't allowed to grow and develop as an individual.",1,aquarius,2018
19,"Today the people around you could seem much more serious than usual, Aquarius. You could even decide to get away from them and go hide out just for the day, for example, in a movie theater watching an afternoon film. But you won't find the movie you want to see. Don't try and run away from the gravity of the moment; you may become even more serious than the people you are running away from.",1,aquarius,2018
20,"You have a kind of creativity that knows no bounds today, Aquarius, and a kind of originality that knows no limits. How are you going to go about expressing this rich creativity that abounds inside of you? If your environment doesn't allow you to express this creativity, change environments and try to make a new reality for yourself. This is the only way you'll be able to use this incredible energy productively.",1,aquarius,2018
21,"Today you should be feeling very energetic, Aquarius, both physically and mentally, and you're likely to feel rather anxious for some physical activity. Go for a workout if you have time or for a short walk if you don't. A lot of your time is likely to be spent working on challenging tasks that keep your mind active. You should be pretty keyed up by the evening. Unwind by having a glass of wine and watching a favorite video.",1,aquarius,2018
22,"If you're into gardening or in any way working with the land, you're likely to spend a lot of time doing it today, Aquarius. A friend or family member could help. Anything planted today is likely to grow and thrive, so don't worry about seeds that don't sprout. You might spend a bit too much time doing it, however. Work only until you're pleasantly tired, then quit for the day; otherwise, you might burn yourself out.",1,aquarius,2018
23,"Usually you prefer to approach events with a practical and scientific attitude, Aquarius, but today you're feeling especially intuitive and more aware of the other worlds, so it might be difficult to hang on to your usual mindset. Some uncomfortable feelings you've had about events in the news could prove to be accurate, which might be a bit disconcerting. Remember that there is so much in the Universe that can't be explained through logic or science!",1,aquarius,2018
24,"Don't let another person's small, thoughtless comment ruin your entire day, Aquarius. People may be a bit stingy with everything from money to emotions to time spent with loved ones. The more you tell someone else that they're wrong, the more that person is going to reject your advice. In general, this is a good time to simply stay out of other people's way.",1,aquarius,2018
25,"Today may start out being a very frustrating day, Aquarius. Be prepared! Some equipment with which you work might suddenly go out of order and it could take a while to get it fixed. A temporary separation from a romantic partner could also be disappointing. You may have a lot of physical energy for which you have little immediate outlet. Take a long walk. This could not only provide an energy outlet but clear your head as well.",1,aquarius,2018
26,"You probably won't want to spend much time at home today, Aquarius. Most likely you'll want to be out and about, perhaps at a large gathering, perhaps just strolling down a city street watching the people go by. Insights and revelations come to you that you'll probably be able to make more sense of than you usually do, because mind and feelings are joined in a very effective partnership. Write your ideas down! Enjoy your day.",1,aquarius,2018
27,"If you're still using the old shovel and rake out in the fields, now is the time to upgrade, Aquarius. Get that big piece of machinery that will plow all the acres in no time. In a nutshell, think about ways in which you can be more efficient. Feel free to invest in those things that will help make your life easier and more comfortable. Most likely, the natural flow of the day will take you to exactly where you need to go.",1,aquarius,2018
28,"If you're involved in a class or if you find yourself in any kind of group activity or social situation, be prepared for quarrels to break out among the people there. You could find this extremely useless and counterproductive, and you might be tempted to try to break in and put a stop to it. It's best to stay out of it, Aquarius. Get rid of your frustration by walking home! You'll feel better for it.",1,aquarius,2018
29,"Make your time spent with others much richer by contrasting it with time spent absolutely alone, Aquarius. You'll find that the more energy you can focus on yourself and your own thoughts for a while, the more you will have stored up in your emotional battery to share with others when you're with them. Be more selfish with your energy in terms of making sure that your inner sanctuary is being tended to regularly.",1,aquarius,2018
30,"Travel by air, perhaps in the company of some friends, could well be in the works for you, Aquarius. A group with which you're affiliated might want to take a trip together, perhaps to a place associated with artistic or spiritual traditions. Your romantic partner could accompany you as well, making it as much a romantic getaway as an adventure. Take plenty of money with you! Your friends will want to go to nice places.",1,aquarius,2018
31,"Some fascinating new information, possibly about spiritual or metaphysical matters, could come your way today via books, magazines, TV, or the Internet, Aquarius. This could set you off on a new course of study. Your own insights and revelations could prove invaluable in increasing your understanding of what you read. In the evening, expect a surprising letter or phone call from someone you haven't heard from in a long time. Enjoy your day.",1,aquarius,2018
1,"Your upbeat and active nature is exactly what turns people on to you, Aquarius. Attention is apt to turn in your direction today when social acquaintances realize what an incredibly capable person you are. Focus on your strengths and accentuate these points in everything you do. The people around you will find you irresistible. You have a solid green light when it comes to love and romance tonight.",2,aquarius,2018
2,"There is a powerful force that seems to be working against you today, Aquarius, but realize that you do have the power to produce a positive outcome. Use this conflict to find balance in an unstable situation and try not to rock the boat too much with your superiors. You have a great deal of fire under your belt today and your actions are especially powerful. Consider enrolling in a class or seeking a path of spirituality.",2,aquarius,2018
3,"Are you suddenly falling for an old friend, Aquarius? This may have you confused and a little frightened since you've never viewed this person in this way before. However, this person probably does reciprocate the attraction, so don't completely write it off. Consider this: could this person be a strong part of your future? How well do you know each other? Do you respect this person the way you should? If the answers to these questions are positive, give it a try!",2,aquarius,2018
4,"Don't discount your ability to be extremely resourceful if you need to be, Aquarius. If you don’t have everything you need or all of the required information, take time to think. Who can you ask? What places can you access? Who might know where you can find what you need? Rather than panic because the pieces aren't all there, instead make a list of contacts and go for it. Trust in yourself.",2,aquarius,2018
5,"Today you may notice that you're feeling very creative and ambitious, Aquarius. You might want to use these strengths to work directly on an artistic project. Or you may choose to channel that energy into activities like organizing your home or workspace. If you plan it out, there should be plenty of time to get to both if you have a mind to. Make the most of the day!",2,aquarius,2018
6,"Serious thinking and communication will be enhanced today, Aquarius. These are strong qualities for you anyway, and with this added boost, you'll need to have a place to express yourself. If you’ve started a journal, this can prove to be an excellent outlet. Talking with other people is another. If there are issues or worries that have been bothering you, consider getting together with those involved and airing what's on your mind. It's a perfect day to get things resolved.",2,aquarius,2018
7,"Why not take some much deserved rest and relaxation today, Aquarius? After all, even you need to jump out of the rat race once in a while. If there are some things you really need to care of, you can still make plans for leisure or recreation afterward. Spoil yourself with an afternoon nap or ordering out for dinner. Take a leisurely walk or a long bath. Take care of yourself by resting as well as accomplishing.",2,aquarius,2018
8,"Aquarius, you may find yourself feeling more aggressive than normal today. This can serve you well when it comes to getting what you want, provided no one suffers in the process. It isn’t generally in your nature to step on anyone on the way up the ladder, and you aren’t likely to feel good if this occurs. Look at all possible ways to attain your goals. You're sure to find something that suits you that isn’t harmful to others.",2,aquarius,2018
9,"Settling a dispute may be on your agenda today, Aquarius. You may find yourself getting caught smack in the middle of the stew if you aren’t careful. If this happens, the wisest thing might be to pull out. When you're in this position (especially with two people you care about), the outcome winds up hurting someone, and it may just be you. If you tell them you care about them both too much to get involved, chances are you'll be far better off.",2,aquarius,2018
10,"New opportunities, perhaps involving modern technology in some way, might present themselves to you in such a way as to transform your working life, Aquarius. You could find yourself making a lot of phone calls in this regard, which could keep you busy for much of the day. Your level of excitement is likely to be very high, which makes it important that you remember to take breaks, catch your breath, and definitely get a little exercise.",2,aquarius,2018
11,"Romantic novels and movies might have caused you to feel especially passionate and sensual. Today you long to schedule a romantic evening alone with a love partner, Aquarius. Other social obligations could get in your way, however. You might have made these other commitments a long time ago and they may be business related. It might be far later than you'd hoped before you're able to see your friend. Better late than never!",2,aquarius,2018
12,"Working at home might be the answer for you today, Aquarius. You could be physically and mentally worn out from working too hard, but you still have important tasks to complete. You may operate better on your own territory right now, without having to fight traffic or parking problems. You tend to be very conscientious where work is concerned, sometimes to your own detriment. Don't do this today; otherwise you might burn yourself out.",2,aquarius,2018
13,"Today is a good day to be receptive to other people's energies, Aquarius. You’ll find that a sensitive attitude toward the people around you, combined with a bit of hard work and willingness to fulfill your responsibilities, will make for an unstoppable winning combination. Use this day to collect data and plan your goals. Take responsibility for your actions and don't be afraid to admit your mistakes.",2,aquarius,2018
14,"Bizarre news that comes to you from far away, possibly via email or the Internet, could be spreading like wildfire among the people you know and causing a lot of excitement, Aquarius. Take care that you don't get too excited, since this is very likely to be misinformation that some rather weird minds have garbled. Consider it interesting, think about it, but don't take it seriously unless reliable sources confirm it.",2,aquarius,2018
15,"Your optimism and enthusiasm should be very high today, Aquarius. Business and partnerships have been proving both satisfying and profitable lately, and you could receive information today about new doors that could unexpectedly open up for you. You've worked hard, supposedly without results, for a long time, and now it seems like everything's happening at once. This is very exciting, but remember that if you want to maintain your current pace, you have to keep working! Get going!",2,aquarius,2018
16,"The hard work and good business sense that you’ve put into your job may finally be paying off, Aquarius. Expect some positive changes to take place at the workplace this week. Today you’re likely to be feeling especially energetic and decide to give your house a thorough cleaning. Don't try to do this on your own, however. You need to conserve your energy. Get other members of your household to help!",2,aquarius,2018
17,"An argument with your partner could have you feeling very disheartened and somewhat depressed today, Aquarius. Yet you probably are too shaken up to feel like discussing it with him or her. Spend the day keeping yourself busy and working off your frustration. Forget about it for a while, Aquarius. This should enable you to see the situation more objectively, so that you'll be in the proper frame of mind to kiss and make up when the evening comes.",2,aquarius,2018
18,"A minor conflict with a romantic partner in the morning is likely to end with a tearful reunion and much reassurance by mid-afternoon. The end of the day could find the two of you planning a romantic trip abroad, even down to the restaurants you want to try! Discussions of spiritual or psychic matters could also bring you closer together. All in all, it’s a tumultuous but romantic day.",2,aquarius,2018
19,"Children or possibly some close friends or a love interest could be upset today, Aquarius. The financial coffers aren't full enough to afford something they think they absolutely have to have right now. You might find yourself having to soothe their feelings, reassuring them that ""not now"" doesn't necessarily mean ""never."" If they don't respond, don't keep pushing. They'll have to come to terms with the situation in their own way.",2,aquarius,2018
20,"The day may be temporarily plagued by scandal of some sort, Aquarius. Some of your entourage, particularly women, may gather in conspiratorial gossip. Your curiosity will definitely be aroused, but don't be tempted to join them. There is more to the situation than meets the eye, and you'll want to know all the facts before jumping to conclusions. Concentrate on your own interests and worry about the scandal later!",2,aquarius,2018
21,"Some disappointing news could put you into a rather gloomy state at some point today, Aquarius. Someone close to you might suddenly have to leave town for several weeks and you'll be lonely without them. There isn’t much point in dwelling on this, however. You'll just have to stay in touch via phone or email and look forward to the time when your friend comes back. You should be pretty busy during those days, anyway!",2,aquarius,2018
22,"Some interesting moneymaking opportunities are likely to come your way, Aquarius, either today or in the near future. It could be that it’s time for a new job, one that promises faster progress through the ranks and more financial stability. Once you get past a certain age, working on commission loses its appeal. You’re ready for steady growth in your portfolio. Perhaps you should seek a financial planner for steps you could take right now to improve your bottom line.",2,aquarius,2018
23,"There are plenty of opportunities out there, and you’re tempted to seize every one of them. Well, Aquarius, a bit of discrimination is in order if you’re going to make the best use of the auspicious atmosphere. Travel is definitely in the picture, as is continuing your education in some way. It could be something simple, such as enrolling in a cooking class at an adult education center. Or perhaps you're going to fulfill a lifelong ambition and apply to business school. Good for you!",2,aquarius,2018
24,"Something could happen during the day that unconsciously reminds you of something unpleasant that happened to you in the past, Aquarius. You might not even remember today's event, but memories of the occurrence long ago could plague you throughout the day and put you in a very black mood. Try to analyze why this memory affects you so much. Then when you know, let it go. You might feel as if a heavy weight has been lifted off your shoulders.",2,aquarius,2018
25,"Your head is somewhat in the clouds today, Aquarius. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it just means that it’s difficult for you to get any work done. Much as you'd rather be elsewhere, you really do need to stay focused on the projects at hand. By all means, plan an exit strategy from the mundane routine of your day-to-day life, but don't expect to make your escape today.",2,aquarius,2018
26,"This is bound to be a fascinating day, Aquarius. You may have a foreign visitor who fills your mind with visions of adventures in faraway lands. Anyone you meet today is likely to be interesting, so be receptive to any new people who enter your life. Your curiosity and sense of adventure are piqued. You may decide to take a trip. If you do, be prepared for romance. It’s definitely in the stars for you.",2,aquarius,2018
27,"You may be feeling tired and a bit wrung out today, Aquarius. Although you're a workaholic by nature, even you are forced to admit that this is a day to stay in bed. Give yourself these few hours to regroup and recoup your energy. You'll need to be operating at peak form for all the work that's likely to hit your desk next week.",2,aquarius,2018
28,"Today the energy is on partnerships, Aquarius, probably those begun on the spur of the moment. You and a colleague might have a conversation about the possibility of going into business together. There is also the possibility that you could fall in love at first sight, maybe with someone from far away. Any sort of partnership formed today will have its ups and downs, but with work, it could succeed. If it feels right, go for it!",2,aquarius,2018
1,"If you overindulged last night, you're likely paying the price today. If your head is screaming and your blood feels like molasses, you know that too much of a good thing can make you feel rotten! Much as you feel driven to get out of bed and get on with your chores, there's no point, Aquarius. You'd be better off resting. You'll be your old self by afternoon. Your work can wait until then.",3,aquarius,2018
2,"Sudden events that come to you via TV, newspapers, or the Internet, could shake up long-cherished belief systems today, Aquarius. This could have you feeling momentarily disconcerted and a bit disillusioned. At the same time, this information could open up new doors for you. Your natural curiosity will eventually win out, and you're likely to want to read all you can about whatever is on your mind. New discoveries can be fascinating!",3,aquarius,2018
3,"Your fantasy world will be especially active today, Aquarius, and you should feel free to take off into dreamland. Let your imagination run the show today and you'll be delightfully surprised at the rewards this will bring to your everyday life. It may be hard to make a decision about anything practical, so don't even try. Leave it to a day in which you're feeling more grounded.",3,aquarius,2018
4,"Today you might experience a slight (and very temporary) dark night of the soul, Aquarius. You could take a long look at your life and, even though you're doing well, still feel that you aren't yet where you want to be. Spiritually, you might doubt the traditional views you've questioned and still wonder about new concepts you've adopted. Try to distract yourself through reading or perhaps a movie. This feeling will pass by tomorrow.",3,aquarius,2018
5,"Unexpected communications from people far away could open up new opportunities regarding career, education, travel, or other broadening experiences. As a result, Aquarius, new friendships could develop, as well as new ideas and possibly exciting new goals. Modern technology could play a major role in this development. A trip by air could be on the horizon, probably to a place you've never been before. Don't be too overwhelmed by it all!",3,aquarius,2018
6,"You might find yourself in a difficult situation when faced with a person who doesn't necessarily approve of how you're handling yourself, Aquarius. It could be that someone misinterpreted one of your offhand remarks, and now is violently overreacting. Be careful of shooting back caustic remarks that could only aggravate the situation and elevate it to a damaging level. Your words will be taken more seriously than you think.",3,aquarius,2018
7,"Allow your eager and restless nature to express itself in ways other than through the spoken word, Aquarius. Show someone that you care through your gentle touch or a big bear hug. Hold on a little bit more tightly than you might normally. There's an unspoken understanding that comes when you communicate through nothing but pure silence. Work on developing this kind of connection with those closest to you.",3,aquarius,2018
8,"Your mental processes may run into a snag as you discover that there are certain rules and guidelines by which you need to abide, Aquarius. Sometimes you feel as if you're above all the rules, that you can establish your own based on your personal morals, and that everything will be fine. Unfortunately, you must sometimes obey others' rules. Try not to be upset by this; just deal with it.",3,aquarius,2018
9,"Your mind isn't likely to be on the job today. That could cause a number of problems. You might be feeling especially romantic. You're thinking about the evening when you can be alone with your romantic partner or at least luxuriate in racy novels or sexy movies. At lunch, buy some clothes you feel are especially flattering and then enjoy your evening!",3,aquarius,2018
10,"Plan your moves carefully today, Aquarius, and have patience with the people around you. If you're working with others, be sure they're on the same page with your goals and aims and that they aren't somehow working counter to your purposes. It could be that someone is acting, or reacting, on misinformation that is creating conflict with your thoughts and feelings. Do a reality check before walking out the door.",3,aquarius,2018
11,"You might want to put on your suit of armor as soon as you wake up, Aquarius. An all-out battle is raging out there, and it could seem like everyone has picked you as the main target. Be careful about escalating an issue even more by becoming defensive without first understanding the full scope of the matter. It could be that everything is coming to a head simply because of one slight misunderstanding.",3,aquarius,2018
12,"You may find yourself gravitating toward solid, grounded things, Aquarius, in hopes that these will provide you with the stability that you lack. A key word for you today is patience. Learn how to wait without becoming restless or grumpy. What you will discover after a while is that the stability you seek is actually sitting right there inside of you, and has been all along.",3,aquarius,2018
13,"Issues regarding freedom are apt to come up today in more ways than one, Aquarius. These issues could be connected with opportunities for adventure and travel. Although you initially want to dive into this promised freedom, take time to reflect on what you need in your current situation before making any final decision. Don't forget the other people in your life and how such actions might affect them and your relationships.",3,aquarius,2018
14,"Feel free to take full advantage of the very open social energies of today, Aquarius. You, especially, will feel at home in any social gathering, totally at ease talking to new people and charming the room. This would be an ideal day to meet someone new. Someone of the opposite sex may be particularly attracted to you. Feel free to be as flirtatious as you want!",3,aquarius,2018
15,"Today's emotional energy risks being exceptionally high, Aquarius. You may find yourself at the end of your rope by midday. Try to take a long walk or bike ride in order to calm down. Go by yourself and do some deep breathing outdoors. Try to avoid being drawn into other people's conflicts. Excuse yourself and trust that they can work things out on their own.",3,aquarius,2018
16,"Your heart is longing for a romantic encounter tonight, Aquarius, and the partner in your life is more than willing to accommodate you. Nonetheless, circumstances beyond your control could interfere with your plans, and you might not be able to make contact tonight. This could bring frustration, dissatisfaction, and maybe even a little friction between you. Don't panic, though. It will pass, probably by tomorrow.",3,aquarius,2018
17,"Your energy level is high today, Aquarius, but don't let this turn into a head-in-the-clouds attitude. Keep one foot firmly planted on the ground, because you may need to keep a level head in a work or personal situation. Keep in mind that the best way to deal with this is to use your positive energy to heal the difficult situation instead of letting this difficult situation get you down.",3,aquarius,2018
18,"If you've been thinking about trying some new investments or starting a new savings plan, this is the day to get started, Aquarius. You're a lot more mentally focused than usual. People around you might have ideas that you should consider. You might experience some intuitive insights, so go with your gut. Don't let your mind get in the way. Tonight, keep a notebook by your bed to record your dreams!",3,aquarius,2018
19,"There is a great deal of unexpected communication coming your way today, Aquarius, but be careful about the people you trust. There's an element of fantasy factored into the picture. This might cause some disruption if you automatically accept everything at face value. Make sure you check your sources at least twice before proceeding. You'll be much better off if you prepare for the worst.",3,aquarius,2018
20,"Overindulgence last night could have left you feeling a little woozy today, Aquarius. You're may want to spend the day in bed, but the prospect of leaving tasks undone could cause you to push on anyway. That's a bad idea. Rest is just what you need. Don't force yourself to socialize, either. You need some time alone to recover and gather your resources so you can face the world with a clear head.",3,aquarius,2018
21,"A trip by air could be very much on your mind today. Perhaps you're planning a vacation with your family or a romantic partner. You could well be caught up in the excitement that seems to be the driving emotion today. Friends could offer advice, Aquarius, but you aren't in the space to accept it, as your self-confidence is high. Expect to spend the evening in the congenial company of friends.",3,aquarius,2018
22,"Work may seem more like a drag than usual, as today your thoughts are at home with family, friends, and your partner in life, Aquarius. You're unlikely to concentrate on work, and you might reach for the phone constantly to seek a friendly voice. Images of beautiful objects may dance in your head. Don't worry about your concentration. It will be back tomorrow!",3,aquarius,2018
23,"Memories welling up today could trigger a desire to get in touch with old friends, Aquarius, or relatives you haven't seen in a long time. Some of these recollections could be bittersweet, bringing pain experienced in the past to the surface once more. Don't hang on to these ancient grievances. Work them out in your mind and then let them go. You might experience a deep-seated relief. You could even feel a little lightheaded.",3,aquarius,2018
24,"A business or romantic partner may seem a bit preoccupied with some very serious matters today, Aquarius, and not be likely to share them with you. Asking to talk about it won't work, so you'll probably end up depending on your intuition. Your friend is probably concerned with the health of a family member who may need surgery. Don't feel excluded. Your friend will talk when the time is right. Be patient!",3,aquarius,2018
25,"Whatever work you do today could go more slowly than usual, Aquarius, as you're apt to be a bit distracted. You may be preoccupied with the past, especially with feelings and events you thought you'd long forgotten that affect your mood in various ways. This might be a good day to concentrate on routine tasks that you can do automatically, if possible. That way you'll be as productive as always.",3,aquarius,2018
26,"You're apt to be especially attuned to the thoughts and feelings of partners at this time, Aquarius. In fact, you might find yourself picking up so much that it's a bit overwhelming. Nonetheless, it is an advantage. You'll probably know instinctively what those around you want, and this new sensitivity should definitely score you some points with business and romantic partners alike. Don't be afraid to make use of it. That's what it's there for.",3,aquarius,2018
27,"It doesn't seem fair that your workload has increased these last few days. Never mind that you still have all of your normal tasks to do, your boss expects you to finalize a new budget and write a proposal as well? Enlist the help of others if you can. If you can't, simply do the best you can without sacrificing time with your family and loved ones. Ultimately, Aquarius, the latter is more important.",3,aquarius,2018
28,"A website or TV documentary could put you in touch with a promising educational or spiritual organization whose goals and aims seem to jibe perfectly with your own, Aquarius. This could capture your interest and cause you to want to learn more. A friend may also want to explore this territory. Attend a class or workshop together and experience the programs directly. You may want to get actively involved.",3,aquarius,2018
29,"A keen ability on your part to blend the worlds of intellect and intuition could well surface today, Aquarius. The ability to focus both these methods of perception into material reality is apt to give a boost to your career and educational efforts. It also could enhance your romantic life. Anything begun or completed today has an advantage. Try to look closely at this new tendency and make it last. It's definitely a plus!",3,aquarius,2018
30,"Incredible feelings of enthusiasm, optimism, and sheer joy could fill your heart and mind today, Aquarius. Your life is changing in a positive way, and even though it may not be readily apparent, you're sensing it intuitively. Romance with someone from far away could be in the offing. If you're a writer, publishing is right around the corner. The only downside is that you might feel panicky, as if all this will disappear. Stay focused!",3,aquarius,2018
31,"Money worries could cause you to resist attending a group event with some friends, Aquarius. Are you afraid you'll be tempted to spend more than you can afford now? You probably will, but that's no reason to stay away. Leave your checkbook and credit cards at home. Take only a minimal amount of cash. If you see something you can't live without, take the name and number of the vendor for later.",3,aquarius,2018
1,"Is your sweetheart out of town, Aquarius? If so, you're probably feeling a bit lonely and insecure. You need to ignore those fantasies of your beloved out on the town having a great time with lots of glamorous people. Your friend is most likely as bored as you are, either transacting business or fulfilling family obligations. Relax, find something to do, and the time will pass before you know it.",4,aquarius,2018
2,"You could get the feeling that something is wrong today when it isn't, Aquarius. It's probably just your perspective that needs some adjusting. Pull out your binoculars and focus a bit more so you can stand back yet have the power to examine the details closely. Don't automatically assume there's a clear distinction between right and wrong. There are likely a great many shades of gray, too.",4,aquarius,2018
3,"You could feel increasingly uncomfortable as the day goes on, Aquarius. Perhaps you're tongue-tied in conversations - quite rare for you. The problem is that you simply don't know what to say, or if you do, you don't feel comfortable saying it in front of these people. Perhaps you feel you've lost your edge. Don't despair. This is only a passing phase. You should return to your full-blown communicative self before long.",4,aquarius,2018
4,"You might be pegged as the wise guy who's unable to take anything seriously, Aquarius. Regardless of the situation, you can turn it into a joke of some sort. Your humor likely lifts the spirits of everyone around you. Be careful of taking this too far, however. There could be some people who are uncomfortable with your constant jesting. Let them know that you do have a serious side, too.",4,aquarius,2018
5,"Today can be a relaxing day, provided you make the necessary effort to deal with material constraints, Aquarius. You would like nothing better than to spend much of the day planning fun activities for the future. But, alas, demands from your family, friends, or boss force you to concentrate on the here and now instead. Still, don't abandon your wonderfully pleasing ambitions altogether.",4,aquarius,2018
6,"It's possible that the last few weeks have allowed you to gain a little clarity on certain questions you may have about your vocation, Aquarius. You might even be a little clearer about your feelings concerning what your destiny might be. The planetary energy makes this a good time to stop thinking about such questions and let your life take over. You are well prepared for this kind of thing!",4,aquarius,2018
7,"An unexpected visit from someone who lives far away is likely to throw your schedule off kilter, Aquarius. Even though you'll be glad to see your friend, the visit could require a lot of calls to break appointments and postpone meetings. Once that's done, however, you'll have a good visit. You and your friend should each have a lot to report. You'll talk for hours. Relax and have some fun!",4,aquarius,2018
8,"An intense conversation with your romantic partner could take place today, Aquarius. This could involve taking the relationship to the next commitment level, and the subject of marriage could come up. If you're already married, this could mean taking on a new responsibility, such as a house or child. If you aren't currently involved, expect to meet someone new and exciting who appeals to you on a number of levels.",4,aquarius,2018
9,"A moody family member could have you confused, Aquarius, and you might not be able to discern the best way to find out what's bothering him or her. Don't overanalyze the situation. The best way is probably just to come right out and tactfully speak your mind. You'll probably find that this person simply has some minor problems to work through - nothing serious enough to worry about.",4,aquarius,2018
10,"A lack of physical and mental energy as well as motivation could have you in a lethargic mood today, Aquarius. You won't feel like doing much of anything. You might get extremely irritated at the thought of having to work in any way. It might be a good idea to go to a movie in the evening, preferably a thriller or action movie. This will get your juices flowing again.",4,aquarius,2018
11,"Tending to paperwork could take up much of your time today, Aquarius. A lot could be riding on your careful planning and projections, so you're probably taking it very seriously. Nonetheless, don't be intimidated. Trust your instincts. You know what you're doing. Be very thorough, check everything over carefully, then put your plan into action and wait for it to bear fruit!",4,aquarius,2018
12,"Have you been planning a trip by air, Aquarius, perhaps to a distant place associated with a specific spiritual tradition? Warm places like Egypt, Mexico, or Israel could be especially appealing now. You could be going with a group of friends. If you haven't been considering such a journey, think about it. You might receive some surprising insights and revelations from such a trip. Start planning it now. Go for it!",4,aquarius,2018
13,"You need to pull yourself up by the bootstraps, Aquarius. Why not take a few steps back and try to look at your life more objectively? Regardless of what you might be thinking at the moment, you do have a terrific life. Stop and count your blessings. Make a list and keep it in your wallet to refer to at low moments. Force yourself to be festive tonight. It will do you good to get out.",4,aquarius,2018
14,"The right moment to ask for a raise or apply for a promotion or new job could come your way today, but you'd better make use of it or the opportunity could pass you by. A chance for a romantic encounter or fun evening with friends could also come up. Whatever pleasant things arise today aren't sure things, Aquarius, so don't let them escape. They could be significant milestones for you.",4,aquarius,2018
15,"If you've been thinking about making a career change, Aquarius, today is a good day to do some research on professions that interest you. It may be that you're ready to take the leap and start a business of your own. Ideally, you'd have an able partner to help with the planning and execution. Get out your address book and college directory. It's likely that you already know the perfect person for the job.",4,aquarius,2018
16,"If you find yourself second-guessing plans you made earlier, Aquarius, perhaps for a plane trip, try to look objectively at your concerns. You don't have to cancel everything if you have money worries. Your fears will probably turn out to be unfounded. This could be a good time to look into learning more about modern technology, either by enrolling in a class or attending a lecture. Evaluate vacation plans or a class with an analytical eye.",4,aquarius,2018
17,"Don't take any information you receive today at face value, Aquarius. Technical glitches will likely plague you throughout the day. Your bank statement could be incomprehensible. Bills could show up with an extra zero tacked on. Don't panic. Make some phone calls and get all the facts. Whatever you do, don't let this ruin your day. Everything will get sorted out. Relax, put your feet up, and treat yourself to a cappuccino.",4,aquarius,2018
18,"Today should be devoted to paperwork and getting your financial affairs and budgets in order, Aquarius. Once this is done, you can relax in the evening with friends and loved ones. You're especially intuitive right now, so you'll be able to pick up on all the unspoken thoughts and feelings of those around you.",4,aquarius,2018
19,"Guilt can be a powerful motivator, Aquarius, but it isn't a pure one. Today you could feel obligated to help a family member with something you'd prefer to take no part in. There are times, like this, when familial duty trumps personal desires. Do your best to be helpful and gracious even though it could be a trying time for you. You'll feel good about yourself once it's all done.",4,aquarius,2018
20,"Whatever you're working on at this time can be expanded tremendously with the help of a partner, especially a creative project or written work, Aquarius. Watch as one seed of an idea blossoms into a whole field of creativity. There is more than meets the eye as you find yourself soaring higher and higher. Remember that you're only restricted by your own imagination, so dream big.",4,aquarius,2018
21,"Messages from a distant state or foreign country, possibly through fax, email, or website, might not be totally accurate, Aquarius. If any information presented in this fashion sets off an alarm bell in your head, be sure to do some research on your own and check out the facts. Don't accept any news at face value today. The lines of human and technical communication are definitely out of whack today.",4,aquarius,2018
22,"Are you going on a trip or possibly moving, Aquarius? Is education involved in some way? Whatever your reasons for going away, you're going to gain whatever you hope for - and more. Writing, teaching, and anything involving communication should go very well right now, including conversations with a romantic partner. Your mind is quick and retentive right now, so make the most of it.",4,aquarius,2018
23,"Today you could encounter a work colleague and suddenly feel an unexpected romantic attraction, Aquarius. This could catch you off guard because you never before thought about this person in that way. Before jumping in with both feet, give yourself some time to come down. You're feeling especially sensual today, so this might well pass by tomorrow. Stay grounded for now. If the attraction is still there in a few days, think about it!",4,aquarius,2018
24,"Don't take anything you hear today at face value, Aquarius, especially where money is concerned. A well-meaning friend could approach you with an opportunity not to be missed. Listen to the pitch and take down all the information, but don't make any kind of commitment. You'll likely see several flaws when you review the information later. Point them out to your friend. You'll save this person money and embarrassment by speaking up.",4,aquarius,2018
25,"You could have a “eureka!” moment today, Aquarius, as events from your past unexpectedly bubble to the surface of your mind and crystallize in a surprising new way. Suddenly, you have a clear understanding of how these past events affect your present behavior. You can use this new knowledge to bring about change. There is clearly a situation at work or at home that is in need of transformation.",4,aquarius,2018
26,"You probably know that you don't attain freedom in one fell swoop, but rather bit by bit as you go through life, Aquarius. Perhaps you've been feeling as if you don't have enough freedom. Over the next few days you could find the situations or people you need in order to liberate yourself. Don't forget that love is the greatest freedom of all. It could be time to make room for it in your life.",4,aquarius,2018
27,"You have certainly felt better than you do today, Aquarius. We'll pause here while you go and fetch the aspirin. The stomachache and headache are simply the result of recent overindulgence. Don't worry - you'll be fit as a fiddle by tomorrow morning. Next time someone offers you multiple helpings of food or drink, however, you might want to consider politely declining!",4,aquarius,2018
28,"Today you might feel a little out of sorts, Aquarius, and your concentration could be diminished. You might even have a little trouble focusing on your work. Don't worry about it. It's more mental than anything else, and it will pass. You might feel the need to drink coffee all day to stay alert. Try to exercise some restraint on this, since it could be counterproductive. Hang in there.",4,aquarius,2018
29,"Friendships and romantic bonds should provide a rich source of support and good companionship today, Aquarius. Conversation is likely to be light, covering general matters like current events and the weather, but this might be just what you need right now. Someone could introduce you to some new friends from far away who have some intriguing news of their own. This should prove a light, restful, and altogether very pleasant day. Enjoy!",4,aquarius,2018
30,"A neighbor or relative might volunteer to help you with some chores around the house, Aquarius, but you could sense that his or her heart isn't in it. This person is probably thinking about things and just needs some kind words and a little advice. Just accept that even though you have help, you'll probably end up doing most of the work yourself. Offer what support you can, and think of it as good karma.",4,aquarius,2018
1,"Some of your demons may come back to haunt you today, Aquarius. You could find yourself battling some of those same old doubts and insecurities that you thought you'd left behind. Your desire for a higher standard of living will have you preoccupied with money concerns in the middle of the day. These concerns will pass, so take a deep breath and try not to worry too much.",5,aquarius,2018
2,"Yes, Aquarius, your projects have taken some time to get set up. This is because you haven't been concentrating hard enough. You are doing several things at once, with the result that things have been moving more slowly than you expected. Your change in orientation requires you to focus your energy in a single direction. However, the question remains - what direction?",5,aquarius,2018
3,"You're apt to speak and act with a great deal of power, Aquarius, but be careful that you don't get swept away by emotion. There's a surrealistic quality to the day. It could lead you to believe a mirage is real. You might get so caught up in the drama of your feelings that your power of reason gets watered down to the point where you lose track of your objectivity altogether.",5,aquarius,2018
4,"Just for today, Aquarius, ignore your habit of always trying to find an explanation for everything. Something is changing inside you and in the way you react to situations. The desire to incorporate life's more unpredictable aspects into your personality is the basis for these changes. A lot of your theories are only there to reassure you, but you probably know that. Why not try being honest with yourself?",5,aquarius,2018
5,"Old memories, traumas, and phobias from the past could affect your mood today, Aquarius. You might feel depressed without really knowing why. An event in your life has brought these feelings near the surface without revealing the source. If you've had any disturbing dreams or visions lately, write them down. They might offer a clue as to what's bothering you. Meditation or free association could also bring the release you need.",5,aquarius,2018
6,"Uncertainty about professional matters can lead to an increased determination to get ahead, Aquarius, despite confusion as to how to do it exactly. It might be wise to do some research, organize all your information, and use that to formulate a plan of action. The resulting advancement may be slow moving, but it's sure and steady. A wealth of experience that enriches your life should follow.",5,aquarius,2018
7,"Your physical vitality should be quite strong, Aquarius, and you're encouraged by greater self-confidence. At the same time, however, someone seems to be trying to ruffle your feathers by being selfish and disrespectful of your space. This is likely to lead to conflict that you don't need. The good news is that it's likely to open you up to a different perspective, one that can ultimately be useful in understanding the situation.",5,aquarius,2018
8,"Things are coming to a difficult stalemate regarding the love in your life, Aquarius. Perhaps you've felt like everything was going fine and you had nothing to worry about. In reality, this notion of ""fine"" was just your self-denial hard at work making you think that you could continue on your path without really considering how your actions affected others. Be prepared for a reality check that you didn't see coming.",5,aquarius,2018
9,"This is a good moment to adapt your logic and reason to reality, Aquarius. If you don't, you're going to run into some intellectual problems. Everyone knows that you find new ideas plentiful, but unless you have plans to be a novelist, link your thinking to reality. The ""pie in the sky"" thinking that you engage in isn't particularly useful to the rest of us living here in the real world.",5,aquarius,2018
10,"The mood is one of bustle and change, Aquarius. It's a good day to clear out your wardrobe or other belongings. Out with the old, in with the new! You may consign the old stuff to the basement or give it to charity. The main thing is to make room for your new tastes and new relationships. A new person is being born in you. Clear the path for this being to come through!",5,aquarius,2018
11,"Although the forecast is stormy, the day ahead may give you an opportunity to free yourself from your family, literally or figuratively. Be wary even if the course seems clear to you. You could be in danger of being swayed by a powerful person. The resolutions you make today could have a major impact on your future.",5,aquarius,2018
12,"If you've been feeling deep anger, today isn't the day to let it out but rather the day to consider its source. Any large gatherings of family or friends should be avoided at all costs. No, this doesn't mean you get to take the day off! Just be extra careful about your temper. A little isolation will go a long way toward easing your tension, and may give you some important insights.",5,aquarius,2018
13,"New investment possibilities could present themselves to you today, Aquarius. This could involve an investment of time, money, or other resources. You might also consider an exciting new start of some sort. Don't let yourself get so excited that you move ahead before you consider all the pros and cons. You might want to consult a friend or your partner. This would make an excellent excuse to schedule a romantic evening!",5,aquarius,2018
14,"A new phase in your life is beginning, Aquarius. The previous phase could be interpreted as having taught you to be serious and devoted to professional responsibilities. And you did accomplish some good deeds to boot. Now you can relax and look ahead to what's next. Let yourself feel the welcome tug of the future.",5,aquarius,2018
15,"The only good thing about being on an emotional roller coaster is that you never feel the same way for long, Aquarius. One moment you're up, the next you're down. You can't figure out what it is you want today. Rather than bring your loved ones along on this wild ride, why not take some time away from your usual environment? You'll be a lot better off alone. Who knows? Something important may come out of these moments of solitude!",5,aquarius,2018
16,"It's possible that the last few weeks have allowed you to become a little bit clearer concerning certain questions you have about your vocation, Aquarius. You may even have a little more clarity about your feelings regarding what you think your destiny is. It would now be better for you to stop thinking about such things and let life take over. You're well armed for this!",5,aquarius,2018
17,"You might feel like your emotions are up in the air, Aquarius. As soon as you feel emotional, there may be a more structured force telling you to be reasonable. Both camps are valid, so try not to let one overpower the other. Don't completely disregard your emotions in favor of a more cerebral way of handling a situation. And don't let your emotions take control of your actions either. Balance is the watchword today.",5,aquarius,2018
18,"Dare to express your ideas without fear of ridicule. This is what the planetary configuration has to say to you today, Aquarius. And this is exactly what you need to hear, because fear of ridicule is generally your Achilles heel. The challenge for you is to clearly say what you think without referring to or borrowing the ideas of others. Dare to do it!",5,aquarius,2018
19,"Seduction through words is your real power, Aquarius. You have a great talent for anything involving words. So you're going to be able to attract even more admirers around you today! With the current planetary energy at work, you'll surely get first prize in any contest of words. If you've been thinking about writing a love letter or a profile for a dating website, by all means, do so now!",5,aquarius,2018
20,"Discipline and a sense of duty have been major themes for you lately, Aquarius. It might seem like someone has put the brakes on a current plan of yours. Try not to see this as negative. In reality, this is an important time for you to slow down and plan. Be aware of the passage of time and consider using this period to organize your scattered energy. This is a good time to focus and streamline your life.",5,aquarius,2018
21,"Your lighthearted social demeanor could find a hard time fitting in with the general mood of the crowd today, Aquarius. You might find that you're better off simply locating a quiet place and retreating from the group for a little while. Read a good book or magazine. Plan for the days ahead and let your mind prepare for the things you have in store.",5,aquarius,2018
22,"The current configuration of the planets will make you the bearer of a new philosophy, Aquarius. This doesn't mean that you'll be New Age, but more precisely that you'll have ideas that evolved from it. It's easy to imagine you attending conferences given by the leading minds of the day. Most assuredly, you're searching for answers. Be careful about being too easily convinced by any ""truth"" that comes your way.",5,aquarius,2018
23,"If situations get too hot and heavy, Aquarius, your first instinct is to run away or jump to the next subject before anyone notices you're avoiding the serious ones. That's one way to deal with today's intensity, but deep down you know it isn't the best. What you really need to do is dig deep and take advantage of this emotional energy to thoroughly take care of things instead of skim over them.",5,aquarius,2018
24,"Your heart is going pitty-pat, Aquarius, and you're tempted to escape to a romantic fantasyland in which you play the starring role. The bad news is that something could be trying to hold you back. It could be that responsibility is coming on the scene and reminding you that work needs to be done here in the real world before you can go off to your little fairytale world.",5,aquarius,2018
25,"“Evidence” is the word for today, Aquarius. Everyone knows that you have a facility for spending your time thinking and analyzing. Today, on the other hand, you're going to be ""seeing” things. They will be clear. It will no longer be necessary to study, ponder, and review from every angle. It's a little like you've just invented a new theory that repeatedly gets confirmed by others throughout the day.",5,aquarius,2018
26,"You might find that your brain is chugging along in the slow lane today, Aquarius. It could even be gradually creeping over to the breakdown lane! It may be more difficult to come up with your quick, witty rebuttals in conversations. Take your time and make sure you choose your words very carefully. Communicating with others might be a bit like pulling teeth today.",5,aquarius,2018
27,"Issues involving fashion, magazines, and the spoken or written word will all slowly begin to take a turn in a positive direction today, Aquarius. You may find that these things have been somewhat obscured lately, or at least their development has been more backward than forward. The good news is that the tide is turning. You should notice over the next few weeks that things are getting back on track.",5,aquarius,2018
28,"The key for you today is to use your heart more than your head, Aquarius. Base your actions on your feelings and your inner knowing of the situation. Facts may deceive you. It could be that you've come to rely so much on a linear, logical way of thinking that you can't see any other way. It's important that you see the interconnectedness of many of the different areas in your life.",5,aquarius,2018
29,"It may be that you've returned deeply changed from a long voyage, Aquarius. Of course, we're all changed to some extent by travel, but in your case, the change is truly profound. You're going to have some problems getting back into the life you had before you left. Your old life is likely to feel too limiting to you. So what are you waiting for? Change it!",5,aquarius,2018
30,"Take off to the stars today, Aquarius, and keep your mind and heart open to all the possibilities that can come when you have faith in yourself and the work you do. Mastery of a skill comes when you have the guts to always take it to the next level. Consider different areas of your life that require more of that confidence at this time. Implement this courageous attitude.",5,aquarius,2018
31,"Like playing a game of chess, you may need to think through your next move carefully, Aquarius. It could be that your opponent is taking a long time to make the next move and you're impatient. As a result, you may make your decision too hastily. Feel free to take as much time as you need. Your opponent may be thinking two or three moves ahead of you already, so concentrate.",5,aquarius,2018
1,"Today you have the ability to make an important breakthrough in whatever project you work on, Aquarius. Try not to get bogged down by emotions, which may leave you feeling heavy and stale. Infuse the day with a blast of unconventional thinking. Try to adopt a new, fresh attitude toward whatever it is you want to accomplish. A new perspective is all you need to make this day productive.",6,aquarius,2018
2,"Creative inspiration could come from deep within today, Aquarius. Visions, dreams - anything that excites your imagination - could bring ideas for new projects. You might also find that your understanding of others greatly increases, attracting new and old friends. The only downside is you could get so lost in ideas that you temporarily lose touch with the material world. Try to keep a foot in both camps.",6,aquarius,2018
3,"Your mind could be focused on exalted spiritual concepts today, Aquarius. You might decide to make an effort to study spiritual or metaphysical materials, or attend a lecture, workshop, or meditation session with people who share this interest. You might also think about traveling to a country associated with a specific spiritual tradition, such as Israel, Egypt, or India. Write down your insights so you can refer to them later.",6,aquarius,2018
4,"Although you should be feeling especially close to friends, lovers, and family, Aquarius, you might find it hard to communicate with them today. Perhaps they have troubles they prefer to keep private and you're confused, wondering if they're upset with you. Chances are they aren't. However, they probably need to work things out for themselves. Be patient. Try to understand. They may share their problems with you tomorrow.",6,aquarius,2018
5,"You may be looking forward to talking on the phone with someone dear who lives far away, Aquarius, but circumstances beyond your control could get in the way. Perhaps you keep missing each other, or problems with computers or phones throw a monkey wrench into the works. Don't let this dim your enthusiasm. Once you reach your friend, expect to have an exciting and emotionally gratifying conversation.",6,aquarius,2018
6,"Aquarius, today you might hear of opportunities coming from an unusual source and consider taking advantage of them. Values take a more spiritual turn as your material goals are reached. You might make plans to participate more in activities like yoga, meditation, church services, or other groups with a metaphysical focus, and you're looking forward to it. Someone close to you might recommend some interesting books.",6,aquarius,2018
7,"Aquarius, some interesting insights could steer you in the right direction regarding a goal you've been working toward for a long time. You generally prefer logic to ESP, but today your intuition is so strong that it's difficult to resist. You could also feel a burst of physical energy that spurs you on to do whatever needs to be done. Don't worry about what's rational. Follow your heart.",6,aquarius,2018
8,"Today you might find that your social life takes a definite turn for the better. You could receive more than one invitation to parties or group activities, Aquarius, and spend a lot of time on the phone discussing arrangements for future get-togethers. If you aren't romantically involved now, you may meet someone promising. If you're involved, make sure you reserve time for an intimate encounter with your special someone. Have fun.",6,aquarius,2018
9,"People around you might have been expecting a bit more cooperation on your part. You could be nicer and more concerned about their needs. It seems that you've been ill-tempered recently. You like acting this way occasionally. Sometimes you act like a child who wants to play more. If you indulge this urge to play more often, you'll be able to be more loving toward your entourage.",6,aquarius,2018
10,"Are you an intellectual or a poet, a novelist or a playwright, Aquarius? The celestial energy leaves you alone with your anxieties and questions. You are sure of only one thing - words are the friends you've decided to spend the rest of your life with. This is a kind of dream and challenge that corresponds with your Aquarius identity. Get to work. You'll find your vocation and passion in your writing.",6,aquarius,2018
11,"You're a very active person, Aquarius, but today you'll probably be disappointed. If you ask those around you to help with your activities, they most likely won't understand your needs. They'll wonder why you need to move constantly and why you need to create. The day may seem exhausting and complicated to you.",6,aquarius,2018
12,"You generally like to think of yourself as someone who faces life logically and rationally, Aquarius, but today your intuitive side could prove a valuable resource, especially when it comes to dealing with others. Your communicative ability is enhanced by a strong sense of what others are thinking and feeling. This opens the door to more effective interactions with everyone - friends, lovers, colleagues, even strangers.",6,aquarius,2018
13,"A lost possession could be recovered today. A gift, either money or a long-desired item of some kind, could bring tears to your eyes, Aquarius. Your sense of self-worth should be high at his time, and could cause you to feel nurturing towards everyone around you who doesn't have your self-confidence. New opportunities for increasing your income could come your way. Make the most of them.",6,aquarius,2018
14,"You will wake up today on cloud nine, Aquarius. Your morale is at a peak. You will feel totally free and be able to clearly perceive the essentials of life. You have the perfect opportunity to share this gift from the stars with your loved ones. Even after this aspect has passed, you may have trouble getting your feet back on the ground. Don't rush it.",6,aquarius,2018
15,"Today you're about to put your sense of humor to the test, Aquarius. You'll likely confront a few unexpected situations. Even if you're used to finding exciting things to do in an ordinary world, you'll be in for a big surprise or two. Today there will be a lot of excitement where you least expect it. Try to let the day's energy guide you.",6,aquarius,2018
16,"Others, particularly family members, might be rather quiet today. It could seem as if everyone is running around like crazy but not sharing what's on their minds. You'll have to trust your intuition when you need to know what they're up to, Aquarius. Writing could come from deep within, whether through letters, poetry, or novels, allowing you to express a facet you don't often see. Use this spiritual gift and dig deeper.",6,aquarius,2018
17,"Today you're apt to be a bit preoccupied, Aquarius. You might find yourself considering concepts that others think are strange and impractical. This might involve metaphysics or the occult or unusual ways of making a living - or all of the above. You might want to discuss this with others. However, you should make a decision based on your preferences without influence from those who aren't directly involved.",6,aquarius,2018
18,"Some people around you might think that you have never really matured, Aquarius, that you still have the mind of a child. It might not seem obvious at first, but your lighthearted attitude is also a sign of great wisdom. As with those who have truly committed to long-term romances, you will find out that you'll never lose your lightheartedness.",6,aquarius,2018
19,"You have a generous nature, Aquarius. You know how to give and devote yourself to solving the problems others that confide in you. This will still be true today, but not entirely in the same way. In fact, it wouldn't be wise for people to bother you with their problems if they really aren't all that important. It's high time for you to take care of yourself for a while.",6,aquarius,2018
20,"Aquarius, the atmosphere of the day gives you the impression that there could be a lot of changes waiting to unfold in your personal life. Most of them will concern your relationships. Today you could feel as if you've just changed your star sign. Take the time to open up and listen to what the stars might reveal to you. This will be time well spent.",6,aquarius,2018
21,"Research on a subject related to a project could have you heading to a place where you can read without being constantly distracted, Aquarius. Your concentration is high and you're likely to accomplish a lot in this regard. Although you might not find the material as interesting as you'd hoped, the quality of the work you produce is going to get the attention of people in authority. Get going.",6,aquarius,2018
22,"There is a fun-loving, boisterous energy to the day that should give you a great deal of power and self-confidence. You'll be extremely effective in everything you put your hand to, Aquarius. Remember to love yourself and believe in the things you say and do. Generate passionate love from your heart. No one will be able to respond with anything but the same.",6,aquarius,2018
23,"Take it easy today, Aquarius, and work to digest some of the input you've received over the past couple days. This is a day to contemplate and plan. With matters of the heart, you may find that a sensitive, grounded approach works best. This isn't always your favorite mode of operation, but it's one that will provide you with the balance to counteract your usual frenzied pace.",6,aquarius,2018
24,"Go for the gold, Aquarius. Today marks the beginning of the rest of your life. Treat it with respect. You may be on a crusade and your combative instincts could be working overtime. There's a lot of fuel in your engine, so don't worry about running out. The only thing you really need to be concerned about is possibly stepping on other people's toes. Make sure you consider how your actions affect others.",6,aquarius,2018
25,"Recent spiritual breakthroughs might have you feeling both exhilarated and downcast. Your sensitive side tells you that this is a definite step forward on your spiritual path, but your logical side might cause you to doubt the reality of it. Take comfort in the fact that reality is relative, Aquarius. What you're sensing is at least valid for you. Then keep moving ahead.",6,aquarius,2018
26,"Trying to get too much work done in the course of one day might prove self-defeating today, Aquarius. Your energy isn't what it usually is, and you're probably operating on nervous energy. Consider the situation and list your tasks in order of urgency. The world won't come to an end if you don't get them all done today. In the evening, rent a pile of videos, order a pizza, and relax.",6,aquarius,2018
27,"Uptight is the word for today, Aquarius. At some point you might find yourself the center of attention. While you normally might not mind, now it could make you a bit nervous. When you find everyone looking at you and expecting you to say something, say it, keep it short, and then withdraw. You aren't in the mood. Go to the library and read about subjects that interest you to relieve the stress.",6,aquarius,2018
28,"You may feel some indecision regarding a loved one today, Aquarius. Something could be urging you to act in this department, yet you might find that you just want to lay low. Realize that there's an important next step that you must take. Think the situation through before you make a move. In fact, this day is best spent gathering data. Perhaps you should wait before doing something about it.",6,aquarius,2018
29,"An increased understanding of distant cultures as well as curiosity about the people who live there could spur you on to further learning about those places, Aquarius. Friends or groups with which you're affiliated could be involved in some way. You're likely to channel a lot of energy into intellectual activities today and inspire others to do the same. Take a walk at some point during the day to clear your head.",6,aquarius,2018
30,Today is a good day for you to simply get things done. Take care of those annoying tasks that have been building up for a while. You have a great opportunity to accomplish quite a bit. People are less concerned with frivolous drivel and gossip than they are with setting a plan for meeting an important goal. Contribute to this trend by getting serious about the tasks at hand.,6,aquarius,2018
1,"As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you might find that you're leaving behind some fundamental principles and values along the way, Aquarius. Don't lose sight of your foundation. Things could get shaken up today. Your ego might be on trial for pig-headed behavior. Keep yourself in check and be aware of the way you project yourself to others.",7,aquarius,2018
2,"You might find that there's a quality of dreaminess to your emotions today that keeps you from focusing on the task at hand, Aquarius. People are likely to be stubborn and confused, and you could be one of them. It might seem as if your mind is going in two directions and you aren't sure which way to proceed. Try to incorporate more of your dreams into your waking reality.",7,aquarius,2018
3,"Your physical stamina is apt to be quite strong today, Aquarius. You should consider going to the gym to release some of that pent-up energy. Engage in a sport or something that involves strategy and good coordination. Pick up a tennis racquet or join a basketball game. You'll find that your high level of energy will be the key to coming out on top.",7,aquarius,2018
4,"Get up and get going today, Aquarius. You have no time to lose. Your quick mind will be busy working on many tasks, but this suits you just fine. You're well equipped to deal with the many frantic situations that are apt to crop up. There is a great deal of strength to your emotions that you can use to connect with others and communicate your thoughts in a healthy manner.",7,aquarius,2018
5,"You may say one thing one minute and the opposite the next, Aquarius. Usually you can jump from one issue to another with no problem, but today people are likely going to call you on it. Think about what you really mean before you say it. Don't do all your thinking aloud where other people can hear. Your continuous thought process might be mistaken for a final analysis. Confusion could ensue.",7,aquarius,2018
6,"Your mind may seem rather cloudy today, Aquarius, but don't let this hinder you. In fact, you'll find that you can use this feeling of fantasy to your advantage. Try to bring more magic into your life. You'll discover that the more you accept your bizarre feelings and ideas, the more things will fall into place. Don't think that everything in life has to be completely rational.",7,aquarius,2018
7,"Listen closely to the wind, for the answers are blowing around right in front of you today, Aquarius. Make contact with people you haven't heard from in a while. You'll find that you can be quite productive where you least expect it. Ironically, the less you plan, the more you'll get done. Be spontaneous in your actions. Revelations will come to you like lightning.",7,aquarius,2018
8,"This is an important day for you to make valuable connections with others, Aquarius. You'll find yourself engaged in fast-paced, witty conversations and debates from which you can learn a great deal. You're good at seeing both sides of an issue, but the problem is that this can lead to indecisiveness and an inability to commit to anything. Choose a path today and stick to it.",7,aquarius,2018
9,"People may be a bit critical of you today, Aquarius, and you would do well to hear what they have to say. Be receptive of feedback from others so that you may establish a healthy ego. It's important to keep your sense of humility in check. You might find that you're feeling rather critical as you see people moving like sloths compared to your lightning quick mind. Be patient with others.",7,aquarius,2018
10,"The doldrums are over and its time to pick up the pace, Aquarius. Come out of your home in full regalia today and be proud of what you have to offer to the world. Be courageous in your dealings with others and take the time to express yourself fully in a creative manner. The bigger the smile you wear, the further you'll go in just about every situation you encounter.",7,aquarius,2018
11,"You might find yourself daydreaming about faraway places, Aquarius, perhaps toying with the idea of taking a long vacation by air to a place you've always wanted to visit. This isn't a good day to make definite plans. You aren't likely to be inclined to do that now anyway. Love matters may take an unexpected turn, as a spiritual bond seems to be forming between you and a potential romantic partner.",7,aquarius,2018
12,"Be careful not to be too cavalier today, Aquarius. It would be wise to adopt a more serious tone than you normally would. You might be inclined to be careless with your words, but people are going to take you very literally. Make sure you say things that you actually mean. Your attention to fashion and pop culture may conflict with a force that's asking you to focus on things of deeper spiritual value.",7,aquarius,2018
13,"You may have the spark that wants to light things today, Aquarius. Indeed, there's a fast-paced tendency to the day that is right up your ally. You should be able to accomplish quite a bit under the prevailing trends. Just make sure you're constructive with criticism, and be careful that you aren't too abrasive toward the people you deal with. In other words, be nice.",7,aquarius,2018
14,"Social events could put you in touch with a lot of interesting people, some in fields such as law, education, or the ministry. Expect at some point to be treated to a monologue on social and ecological responsibilities, Aquarius! You'll have a lot of definite ideas on those subjects, but you'll be more likely to listen than talk for most of the day. Enjoy your day.",7,aquarius,2018
15,"Romantic feelings blossom today, Aquarius. Your entourage may suddenly appear more attractive than usual. Lovers and potential lovers may seem unusually attentive. You could also be feeling very creative, and you might want to try your hand at poetry or fiction. Reading romantic novels or seeing romantic movies could also be appealing. Surround yourself with candles, flowers, and music, and enjoy!",7,aquarius,2018
16,"Friction with family members, particularly women, could prove irritating, especially since you're torn between their quirks and the love you have for them. This isn't the time to hold grudges, Aquarius. Let them go. You might feel the urge to do some home repairs, redecorate, or otherwise improve your home, or perhaps cook a great meal. Channel your energy into these activities instead of quarreling. You'll be glad you did.",7,aquarius,2018
17,"Do countries abroad represent real opportunities for you, Aquarius? This is a question that you'll soon have to answer. The grass may be greener on the other side of the world, but have you considered the possibility that it isn't? Could it be that the dream of working abroad is a convenient explanation for the dissatisfaction you feel at work? It's important to solve this riddle, because you'll soon make some key decisions that depend on the answer.",7,aquarius,2018
18,"Letters, phone calls, or emails from afar could put you in touch with new, interesting people. These people could well bring some fascinating ideas your way, Aquarius. Shared knowledge can lead to mutual advancement on material and spiritual levels. This process just might turn a casual acquaintance into a firm friend. Expect a lot of contact with these people for a long time to come. Enjoy your day.",7,aquarius,2018
19,"You could feel restless and anxious to get out in the open for a while today, Aquarius, but mundane tasks could force you to postpone it. Someone you care about might ask for a favor, and while you may not want to help this person, you probably will. Don't let your irritation show - just get it done quickly and accept the person's thanks. In the evening, go for a long walk under the stars.",7,aquarius,2018
20,"Situations regarding love and romance are likely to get much heavier and more intense now, Aquarius. Are you ready to make a deeper commitment to the one you love? It may be quite hard for you to make a solid commitment because you could be wary of the freedom you'll lose. Now is the time to face the music and really dedicate yourself to the people who mean the most to you.",7,aquarius,2018
21,"Today it might suddenly hit you that you have a lot of unfinished tasks that need to be completed, and this might lead to a case of the blues. Take heart! The process appears more overwhelming than it is, Aquarius. A little planning and focused discipline should enable you to get through everything without stressing yourself out too much. In the evening, reward yourself with a meal out or a movie.",7,aquarius,2018
22,"Your relationships are going well from an intellectual perspective, Aquarius, but from an emotional one, you might feel like they aren't as fulfilling as you'd like. Perhaps you're letting your brain do too much of the driving. It's time to let your heart take over and have its needs be tended to for a while. As your energy shifts, so will that of people around you. Let them react however they will. Try not to be upset by the changes that follow.",7,aquarius,2018
23,"Take inventory of your habits and behaviors, Aquarius. Look to certain patterns and note the ones that do and don't work for you. You'll more than likely feel an urge to break free from repetition and create new paths that allow for other opportunities to come along. You may not even be consciously aware that in many ways you're beating a dead horse. Don't continue to waste your energy on paths that go nowhere.",7,aquarius,2018
24,"Today isn't a great day for inspiring enthusiasm in others, Aquarius. You might find that there's a sober, conservative tone to the day that's stealing the fuel from your fire. Realize that this is just part of the natural cycle of things. Don't feel that you need to be up and active all the time. Give yourself a rest and focus your energy inward. Settle your nerves and get down to business.",7,aquarius,2018
25,"Don't second-guess yourself today, Aquarius. It could be that you're wavering so much about a decision that even after you make it, you hesitate to follow through with it. Once you make up your mind about something, stick with it. Have confidence in your own mental process. Once you begin to waver, it may be difficult to find the assurance that you need since you'll inevitably slide down the slippery slope of self-doubt.",7,aquarius,2018
26,"Today is a terrific day to express your thoughts, Aquarius. You'll find your mind especially clear and ready to tackle any mental issue that comes your way. Your tendency is toward free and unconventional ways of problem solving. Express the importance of being able to think for yourself. Write letters, make calls, and surprise someone with a personal visit. Connect with friends you haven't spoken with in a long time.",7,aquarius,2018
27,"Consider going on a trip with a close loved one, Aquarius. A long-term break from the current reality may be just the thing needed to infuse a new blast of romance into your life. If you're unattached, you might find that going on an adventure to a foreign country results in meeting the love of your life. Broaden your horizons and look to new ways of thinking and believing.",7,aquarius,2018
28,"Tune into your dreams today, Aquarius. Do you often feel intensely jealous thinking the people around you are living amazing lives while you're stuck in a dull, boring routine? The only person who can pull you out of this rut is you, so stop complaining and do it. Change is easier than it seems at first. Let your imagination take control and work toward manifesting your most fanciful goals.",7,aquarius,2018
29,"Your receptivity to new ideas is stronger than usual today, Aquarius. Listen to what people say and remember that you can learn from every person you meet. There's a lesson in every situation. Remember to keep your brain exercised, just like any other part of your body. To keep it working properly, you must make sure you give it the daily stimulus that it requires.",7,aquarius,2018
30,"It's a long road to becoming exactly the person you want to be, Aquarius. You can't change who you are. Input from every person you know and lessons from every bump in the road contribute to who you are as a person. Be proud of yourself, but also realize that there's a great deal more internal development that needs to be done. Meditate or be alone for a little while.",7,aquarius,2018
31,"You have a keen analytical mind that has served you well in business. Alas, Aquarius, this characteristic doesn't always serve you well in your personal life. It's likely that someone close has bristled from your lack of empathy. Take time to reflect upon the events of the past few weeks. Did you inadvertently send a wrong message? Correct any unintentional slights. A simple ""I'm sorry,"" will do wonders.",7,aquarius,2018
1,"Finally, Aquarius, you'll be able to breathe a long overdue sigh of relief. It's likely that you've been worried about your finances for some time. Well, you need worry no longer. The events of today either put you back in the black or show you a clear path to get there. You've been working hard to resolve these financial matters. You can now start working smarter.",8,aquarius,2018
2,"Be a bit more sensitive with your words today, Aquarius. Your mind is apt to be especially active and even a bit restless. This is more than likely a signal to get more of your opinions out into the world. As you do, make sure you take into account the feelings of others. People might have quite a different reaction to the same situation. Respect opposing viewpoints.",8,aquarius,2018
3,"Be a bit more selective in terms of where you put your energy today, Aquarius. Don't waste your time with situations that aren't healthy or conducive to your aims. You may find it hard to get motivated, but this is fine. This is a good day to lay low. Your energy is apt to feel rather sluggish, so be conservative with how you use it. Pace yourself throughout the day.",8,aquarius,2018
4,"You're riding a wave of prosperity and things are looking up for you, Aquarius. The situation today may appear too good to be true. The bad news is that's probably the case. It may be that the truth is being masked, and that there's a great deal of speculation and hype causing a frenzy of activity. Feel free to join the frivolity, but realize that the bubble may burst tomorrow.",8,aquarius,2018
5,"This isn't a good day to travel, Aquarius, especially by air. Long lines at the ticket counter, endless delays, and lost luggage could be the result. This may not even be a good day to plan a trip, although you can consider your options. If you must fly today, get to the airport early, travel light, and take something good to read. That will make it bearable.",8,aquarius,2018
6,"You may feel a need to add some fantasy to your daily routine today, Aquarius. Do you have someone in mind you'd like Cupid's arrow to strike? Well, don't rely on a cherub to do your work for you. Get out and do some target practice of your own so you'll be prepared when you see the object of your desire across a crowded room. Keep things light and cheerful.",8,aquarius,2018
7,"Don't be surprised if you leap out of bed with a spark of inspiration that wasn't there last night, Aquarius. Let your dreams linger a bit before you face the world. This flash of genius is likely to strike quickly and unexpectedly, so keep an eye out for it, but don't consider it something that you can plan on or force into happening.",8,aquarius,2018
8,"An unexpected chance to fly to a faraway place, perhaps at someone else's expense, could come to you today, Aquarius. A group might be involved, perhaps one connected with education. Do you lecture or teach? If so, this might be a chance to give a lecture in an exciting place you've never been to before. Get your materials together, pack your bag, and go. Have fun!",8,aquarius,2018
9,"You're probably feeling especially energetic but with little if any outlet for your energy, Aquarius. Increased irritability and frustration could tempt you to take it out on friends, children, or your significant other. On days like this you might want to consider jogging, yoga, or aerobics. These can produce endorphins that override the stress. Go for it.",8,aquarius,2018
10,"Jealousy could rear its ugly head today, Aquarius. This could involve a romantic relationship. Jealousy is often groundless, so avoid it by doing some communicating. This is the time to make the effort to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Strong emotions can work for you under some circumstances. A passionate reconciliation is better than an angry estrangement.",8,aquarius,2018
11,"Expect some great news regarding money, possibly professional advancement. You may have to control the urge to break into tears of joy, Aquarius. A female friend could be going through some heavy changes and might want your support. Your best course of action would be to listen rather than offer advice. You may have to try hard to control yourself, however. The situation could defy all reason.",8,aquarius,2018
12,"Some fascinating new information, possibly spiritual or metaphysical, could come today from periodicals, TV, or the Internet. This could set you on a new course of study, Aquarius. Your insights and revelations could prove valuable in increasing your understanding of what you read. This evening, expect a surprising message from someone you haven't heard from in a while. Enjoy!",8,aquarius,2018
13,"A social event could take place today involving a number of friends you may not have seen for a long time, Aquarius. You'll feel good about catching up and meeting exciting new people, too.

Enjoy.",8,aquarius,2018
14,"This is a great day to start new enterprises with others, Aquarius. Gatherings with friends or group activities could lead to ideas for new projects that fire your energy and enthusiasm. New immediate and long-term goals should be set. Some people may not be interested and could drop out, but don't worry. Others who share your interests will quickly step in to take their places.",8,aquarius,2018
15,"You could feel as if the battle has begun and you're the target, Aquarius. If you don't have a solid force behind you, this period could be difficult. Emotionally, this may not be your best day. Instead of feeling your feelings, you examine them in a methodical, rational manner. It may seem like you're dealing with them when you're really trying to talk yourself out of feeling them at all.",8,aquarius,2018
16,"Don't discount your excellent resourcefulness, Aquarius. If you haven't got everything you need or all of the information required, take some time to think. Who do you know? What resources can you access? Who might know where you can find what you need? Rather than panic because the pieces aren't all there yet, make a list of contacts and go for it. Trust in yourself.",8,aquarius,2018
17,"Today you may feel very creative and ambitious, Aquarius. You might want to use this energy to work on an artistic project, or you may choose to channel it into such activities as organizing your home or workspace. If you plan for it, there should be plenty of time to do both if you have a mind to. Make the most of the day.",8,aquarius,2018
18,"Serious thinking and communication are enhanced today, Aquarius. They're already strong qualities in you, and with this added boost, you'll need an outlet for expression. A journal is an excellent vehicle. Talking is another. If you have issues or worries, consider getting together with all involved and airing your thoughts. It's a perfect day to resolve problems.",8,aquarius,2018
19,"Today, Aquarius, your ability to stand up for your decisions and not let others sway you may be enhanced. This will be especially strong if you've solved a problem. You may find that others often try to change your decisions, but not today. Things are working in your favor and you'll feel new strength as a result. Follow your heart.",8,aquarius,2018
20,"Use your creativity to make things happen today, Aquarius. This doesn't have to take the form of a finished product. You can come up with new and innovative ways to approach a task, project, or problem. Trust your ability to discover such things. You're known for your sharp thinking and creative abilities. Combining them can make you unstoppable when finding solutions to almost any problem.",8,aquarius,2018
21,"Don't worry about being productive today, Aquarius. You might still accomplish more than you have in a long time. The cosmic energy indicates that if you didn't get everything done that you wanted to yesterday, you're sure to do it today. Dig in your heels and go. Things will get done with time to spare. If you're into a creative hobby, work on that, too. You'll find it rewarding.",8,aquarius,2018
22,"You'll find that your spark can easily turn potential energy into kinetic energy, Aquarius. Don't underestimate the power of your words. Realize the profound impact they have on others and take responsibility for their consequences. Try to use them sparingly if you can. Speak half as much as you normally would, but make each sentence resonate twice as powerfully.",8,aquarius,2018
23,"Emotionally, you may feel as if you're running up against a brick wall, Aquarius. It could be that your first reaction is to drown your sorrows in drink. Escapism is only a temporary remedy. If things slam in your face today, use this as an indication that you need to take necessary action. Don't keep bouncing around from one thing to the next in order to avoid the obvious. Face the music.",8,aquarius,2018
24,"Don't be surprised if your inbox fills with email or your phone rings off the hook, Aquarius. Friends, relatives, and colleagues could have great news and useful information. One or more of these messages could inspire you to send a few of your own or even pay some visits. Most of what you learn should be positive and exciting, although some things may be confusing.",8,aquarius,2018
25,"A powerful desire for a current or potential romantic partner might come over you today, Aquarius. This person could live far away or be on a trip, so you might have to be satisfied with a phone call or email instead of the meeting you'd prefer. Don't get frustrated. Distract yourself with an exciting novel or movie and look forward to when you can get together.",8,aquarius,2018
26,"Use the day's boisterous energy to take charge and make things happen, Aquarius. You'll find that actions you take today resonate in the coming days. Don't worry about the consequences.

You'll find that the more in tune you can be with yourself, the better integrated you'll be with the people around you.",8,aquarius,2018
28,"Friendship could turn into romance if you aren't careful, Aquarius. A platonic relationship could turn passionate, and no one would be more surprised than you. Think carefully about where you'd like this to go. While it can't go back to the way it was, you can stop it from progressing further if you're uncomfortable with the new dynamic. You can only make this decision once.",8,aquarius,2018
29,"Any work today could require a higher level of concentration than you can muster, Aquarius. You might lapse into daydreams, think about personal matters, and feel guilty because you aren't doing what you're supposed to be doing. On days like this it's best to focus on routine tasks you can do automatically. That way, your mind can wander. That's the only way you'll make it through today.",8,aquarius,2018
30,"You're feeling pretty strong now, Aquarius. You're probably in fairly good health and your mind is sharp. You've outgrown some areas of your life that no longer seem what they once were. One of these could be your work. You could be considering leaving a job you took primarily for the money and going into a profession you really love. Do it if it works for you.",8,aquarius,2018
31,"You may be focused on a certain trajectory, Aquarius, but today you could run into complications based on overlooked issues. Be aware of the people around you and how your actions affect them. You don't necessarily need to change your direction, but you might need to make a couple modifications along the way in order to keep everyone happy.",8,aquarius,2018
1,"It isn't exactly all lightness and harmony at home today, Aquarius. There's tension in the air and it manifests in silly family arguments. Try to arrange separate activities for siblings, and encourage your partner to eat out with friends. This is a day to give everyone his or her space. Tomorrow everyone will be happy to eat together again.",9,aquarius,2018
2,"People may see you as the personification of drama, especially this morning, Aquarius. This is a good time to express your emotions and get things out of your system. Be sure to release whatever pent-up emotion you have inside. By afternoon, it might be a good idea to settle down and lay low. Turn your energy inward, come to your center, and plan what needs to get done.",9,aquarius,2018
3,"Money is probably on your mind now, Aquarius. A desire for increased financial security could force you to look for work or investments that would pay off big.

You're likely to accomplish what you want for now, but it's uncertain whether you'll continue on this path in the future.",9,aquarius,2018
4,"A trip by air may be in the offing, Aquarius. You may be planning to tour distant states or foreign lands. You could be going with friends or a group you're associated with.

Take care not to spread yourself too thin.",9,aquarius,2018
5,"Your mood may be a bit detached and scattered today, Aquarius. This attitude could get you into trouble if you aren't careful. Make sure you keep at least one foot on the ground. It's important to stay strongly connected with reality or you could find yourself up a creek without a paddle. Feel free to get more deeply involved in a project that you might otherwise leave to others.",9,aquarius,2018
6,"You could be in a fanciful mood all day, Aquarius, so you may not be too focused on this world. This is great for artistic or metaphysical studies, as well as being sensitive to others. Beware of a tendency to daydream when you should pay attention! You might want to break out of the mundane world and follow your dreams, but this isn't the day to do it. It's a good day to plan.",9,aquarius,2018
7,"Some new information could come your way that causes you to focus on a new interest, Aquarius. It'll set your mind traveling to faraway places and times. You may also meet some new people who are highly educated, from foreign lands, or both. They might have fascinating stories to tell! Whatever happens, today promises to excite your curiosity and stimulate your intellect.",9,aquarius,2018
8,"Weariness may have you feeling a bit listless today, Aquarius, and you're likely to want to stay home in bed rather than go anywhere. This goes against your normal inclination, so you could be tempted to bite the bullet and get out in spite of your malaise. Don't fall into this trap. Get some rest so that when you absolutely have to go out, you'll be your old self again.",9,aquarius,2018
9,"Issues regarding love and romance are at a climactic point right now, Aquarius, and you could be rather combative.

10,"You've probably had a busy week, Aquarius, and may feel out of sorts today. Perhaps you had too much good food last night, stayed up too late, or both. It goes against your grain to stay in and rest, but this is the perfect day to curl up with a good book. You're going to want some exercise, but don't overdo it. As you well know, you can get too much of a good thing!",9,aquarius,2018
11,"Your world is changing, Aquarius, both internally and externally. You feel a need to broaden your horizons. You may be contemplating a move to a new neighborhood or trip to a faraway land. The people in your life will change as a result of this. You're about to embark on a new phase of life, and these new friends will act as able guides.",9,aquarius,2018
12,"Group activities that you attend today are likely to be spiritually oriented, such as group meditations. You could meet new friends from faraway places who share your interests. Though you're usually more intellectually inclined, today you should be feeling especially intuitive. Write down your thoughts and ideas lest you forget them. You may want to use them later.",9,aquarius,2018
13,"Stress and job frustration might have you thinking about breaking free, walking out the door, and getting on the first plane somewhere else. Another thought is likely to concern going back to school and training for a career in another field. You might need a vacation, and returning to school could be a great idea, but don't decide today. Wait a few days.",9,aquarius,2018
14,"You could encounter a potential romantic partner today, Aquarius. You'll probably meet this person at a group event and hit it off immediately.

Take advantage of the event to get to know each other. Who knows where this might lead?",9,aquarius,2018
15,"Your fantasy world is piqued today, Aquarius. Your imagination is running wild. Maintain a certain amount of control over your emotions or they may get the better of you.

16,"Does it feel like someone's raining on your parade today, Aquarius? No surprise there. You may feel like you're stuck in a bog, so wear your galoshes and give it your best shot.

Come back to them in a couple days.",9,aquarius,2018
17,"A get-together of some kind is likely to happen during the course of the working day, Aquarius. This should lead to pleasant and interesting conversations, possibly involving philosophy, spiritual matters, or the arts. Communication with those around you should be clear and open. Correspondence could take up almost as much time as conversations right now.",9,aquarius,2018
18,"You might find yourself reeling from shock when an old friend suddenly seems to show romantic interest in you. Conflicting emotions could come up, but don't write it off if you're available. There could be potential for a good relationship with this person. Don't feel that you have to either jump right in or forget the whole thing. You can test the waters for a while!",9,aquarius,2018
19,"Are you presently negotiating a contract, Aquarius? If you and the other party disagree on any points, these differences will most likely be resolved.

21,"A passionate encounter with a love partner might cement the bond between you so thoroughly that you start talking about commitment or even a wedding.

22,"If you've been having trouble reaching a romantic partner, Aquarius, it might be a good idea to stop trying. Your friend is having a rough day and might not make the best company.

If you speak with your friend, keep it brief and plan to get together - just not today.",9,aquarius,2018
23,"Don't be surprised if money comes from an unlikely source. It could be a surprisingly good return on an investment or a bequest from a relative. Pay attention to any dreams that seem to repeat.

24,"Inspiration for writing, music, drawing, painting, or other creative activities could hover just out of reach today, Aquarius. Great ideas could pop into your head and out just as quickly.

25,"Have you been going crazy with all the demands placed on you? Don't despair. Reflect on all that's been going on. Think about where you want to make changes.

The step-by-step approach can bring satisfying results.",9,aquarius,2018
26,"You may be ready for some major career changes, Aquarius. You could be fed up with the stress and long hours of the corporate environment.

28,"You may try to explain something with your brain today when the true understanding of the situation comes only through your heart, Pisces.

29,"Interest in art from distant lands might capture your interest today, possibly through the influence of friends. Your desire to travel may be awakened, and you might toy with the idea of visiting faraway places, perhaps in the company of a lover. If you're serious, start doing research. This is a great day to plan a vacation.",9,pisces,2017
30,"Have you been putting off some work? It may be weighing on your mind. You could work extra hard today to get it out of the way.

You'll have a lot to report!",10,pisces,2017
2,"Your words have tremendous impact today, so think before you speak. It's easy to hurt others' feelings if you don't take them into account.

People will open up to you.",10,pisces,2017

5,"Get things started. You have many fantastic ideas. Really, the hardest thing for you now is to choose which one to pursue first.

7,"This is a very opportune day for you. Say hello to the stranger in line or follow through on a tip or comment. Opportunities are there. All you have to do is grab them.

It's apt to prove a very healing experience. Don't be surprised if people tell you how attractive you look!",10,pisces,2017
13,"Surliness on the part of a partner could catapult you into a gloomy mood. Your friend isn't communicating very well, and you probably wonder if it's something you said or did. Chances are it's not. All signs indicate that it's business. Don't try to force your partner to share these concerns with you, as this will only cause further retreat. Your friend will talk when the time's right.",10,pisces,2017
14,"It's hard to stay centered now. Your mind is on something wonderful that's happening for you. Yesterday it was a fantasy and now it's real!

Things like this don't happen very often.",10,pisces,2017
15,"A woman, perhaps your mother, could visit you today. She may not be in a great mood, so perhaps you'd better take her out in public where she'll have to maintain some self-control.

It's probably not you.",10,pisces,2017

19,"You've always been practical when it comes to financial matters, but sometimes consumerism can cause you some stress. Of course you want to show the special person in your life how much you care, but do you need to spend a lot of money to prove it? Find a balance you can both live with. You don't need to buy a car. A small token of thoughtfulness would be appreciated.",10,pisces,2017
20,Resist the urge to go on a shopping spree today. You're likely to make impulsive purchases. You may be trying to fill a void or compensate for another area of your life that isn't going as well as you'd like.

Be careful of the runners beside you and treat them as friends and supporters instead of opponents.",10,pisces,2017
23,"Someone that you don't really know well may corner you at a social occasion and try to talk you into something. Get all the facts before you commit to anything. Your persuasive powers are high.

24,You may have to take major action today in order to defend your position. Your current mindset has brought you to a certain point and now you're faced with having to defend that point.

You'll feel better about the situation.,10,pisces,2017
30,You may feel like you're riding a fast train to success. Success can be measured in different ways.

5,"Dare to express your ideas without fearing ridicule. This is what the planetary configuration has to say to you today.

Today you could turn into an armchair traveler!",11,pisces,2017

12,"If you experience resistance or frustration in a certain area, you should take this as a sign that you should follow a new route. Things should flow smoothly and easily.

Enjoy your imaginary world, but deal with the practical world, too.",11,pisces,2017
13,"Career matters are probably going well for you, but you might be unsure if you want to continue along this track.

Those who doubted you will be pleasantly surprised.",11,pisces,2017
15,"Turn one part of the project over to someone you feel is more qualified to handle it. There's no sense trying to do everything yourself when you know someone out there is better suited to the task. Today calls for a steady and patient hand. If you don't think you have the skills, admit it. You'll gain more respect by delegating than by trying to muddle through.",11,pisces,2017
16,"Strong forces may make it hard for you to be confident today. You're so intent on maintaining your freedom that you refuse to yield when you should.

26,"Travel to distant lands is a possibility. While you're ready for a change, don't jump at the first opportunity that comes along.

If you view them this way, you should be able to see what they're telling you. They aren't prophesies for the future.",11,pisces,2017
30,"Your tendency is to rush headlong into a new project. Not everyone is caught up in your enthusiasm. Be careful not to steamroll over those you care about most.

It might be time to set aside your project in favor of a romantic outing.",11,pisces,2017
1,"It's true that you aren't ten anymore, but who's to say you can't go back to your childhood now and again?

Keep everything limited to the facts at hand, and work can proceed much more efficiently than if simple issues become big soap operas.",12,pisces,2017
29,"Matters of love seem to be taking a turn for the better. Discuss your relationship with your partner. Your friend may or may not share your opinions, and a compromise may need to be reached. Don't let this dampen your enthusiasm. Romance looks bright for the near future as long as you keep the lines of communication open.",12,pisces,2017
30,"Things may seem a bit surreal for you today, Pisces, so don't take other people's chatter too seriously. Today is a day to reach out and touch someone, so pick up the phone and dial it. It's a good day to share your dreams with others, despite how farfetched they may sound. Others may look at you as if you have three heads, but as long as you're being honest with yourself, there's no reason for you to be shy about sharing.",12,pisces,2017
31,"The weight of too many responsibilities, perhaps involving family, a job, or group affiliation, could be very much on your mind today, Pisces. You may feel like Atlas, carrying the world on your shoulders! You're tired. Perhaps you need to reevaluate your commitments - your innate kindness may have caused you to make too many. Fulfill the ones you have, but think twice before making any new ones. You're important too, after all.",12,pisces,2017
1,"Though you might wake up today feeling a little feverish, Pisces, as the day progresses you'll be your old self again. You should be putting a lot of effort into work, particularly mundane chores and tasks that you'd rather not do. Get them out of the way and then move on to projects that interest you and can fire your ambition and motivation. Work hard in the morning and enjoy the rest of the day.",1,pisces,2018
2,"Take care not to take on too much today, Pisces. Your intentions are certainly good and your motivation pure, but even you are limited by the fact that there are a mere 24 hours in a day. Pick and choose your commitments carefully today to ensure that you can actually do what you say you will do. You'll be more effective and get more satisfaction out of devoting your energy to a few just causes.",1,pisces,2018
3,"You are a hard and conscientious worker, Pisces, and certainly have been applying your skills and doing your best for some time now.

Continue to work hard and be patient and soon it will all prove worthwhile.",1,pisces,2018
4,"It isn't just royalty who gets to live happily ever after in fairy tales, Pisces. You have this right as well. The conditions are ripe for attracting a special person into your life. There is no need to rely on ""expert"" advice for attracting a soul mate. It's your own unique qualities that will beckon to the right one.",1,pisces,2018
5,"The house might seem rather empty today, Pisces, as most of the other members of your household are probably out and about. This is, however, a good time for you to take care of some projects of your own that you've been putting off. They might be tedious and rather boring, but think how good you'll feel when they're finally done! In the evening you might entertain some visitors. Enjoy your day.",1,pisces,2018
6,"An intense dream or vision could result in a spiritual breakthrough of some kind, Pisces, and you might spend much of the day in a bit of a daze, trying to make sense of it. You might see if you can find a few books on the subject, because all signs suggest that reading could bring a lot of useful information your way today. You might also want to write down an account of your experience.",1,pisces,2018
7,"This is a time to take care of yourself in the truest sense of the word, Pisces. This doesn't mean indulging in excesses, but rather just the opposite. Make an extra effort with your clothes and grooming today. Shout down those voices inside that say you don't look as good as you should. You look just fine, and after your care today you will look even better!",1,pisces,2018
8,"Tension between a married couple who are both your friends could have you situated in the most uncomfortable place of all, Pisces: right smack in the middle. Both may want to recruit you to their side, but you'll want to avoid allying yourself with either party. The best you can do is mediate by trying to get each of them to see the other's point of view. Whether you succeed or not, you'll have tried your best.",1,pisces,2018
9,"It's time for you to tap in to that inner resource that you have always known existed. Your ability to heal is extraordinary, and there's no point in denying it any longer. Your mind is like a sponge, thirsty to soak up any new knowledge or practice about the healing arts. You might spend today browsing a New Age bookstore. Or why not spend a relaxing hour lying flat out on a table, learning from the skilled fingers of a master masseuse?",1,pisces,2018
10,"A friend may ask for your assistance with regard to finances in some way, Pisces. It's nothing major, but it might involve a choice that your friend needs to make. Don't try to make the decision for him or her, but do point out enough facts to enable them to realize exactly what's best for them. This way your friend will be sure he or she thought up the idea. Your wisdom will definitely be appreciated!",1,pisces,2018
11,"Study of the occult sciences, whether historical or hands-on experiments, should prove fascinating and enlightening for you today, Pisces. Astrology, alchemy, numerology, or herbalism are all intriguing fields, and your mind should be especially attuned to them. One warning: beware of unethical teachers.

12,"Get-togethers in your neighborhood should prove enjoyable right now, Pisces. Communication with others, particularly about possible new business interests, should bring a lot of positive information your way that you're apt to put to work for you. The level of respect that you get from those around you could be particularly gratifying. Your hard work has not only enriched your socioeconomic standing but your friendships as well. Enjoy your day.",1,pisces,2018
13,"You might be introduced to a new colleague, Pisces. Don't be surprised if this person makes your flesh crawl. This could be a warning signal or it could simply mean that this person is absolutely terrified and therefore acting defensive. Don't jump to any conclusions about this person until you get to know him or her better. Remember, always give others the benefit of the doubt whenever possible.",1,pisces,2018
14,"Paperwork involving money could be a real drag today, Pisces, but someone close to you might just show you a way to get it done quickly and efficiently on computers or via another technological innovation.

It's important to follow your heart at this time. Go for it!",1,pisces,2018
16,"Today you might feel as if you're living in a fog, Pisces. Some interesting but puzzling news may come your way today. It might be information of such a bizarre nature that you find it difficult to accept, yet your source could be more than reliable. Conversations with others might seem vague and uncertain, as those around you aren't really feeling all that communicative. You might have to rely on intuition to discern how they're feeling.",1,pisces,2018
17,"Today should prove a busy day on all levels. Inspiration for creative projects, particularly writing, should come to you in profusion, Pisces, and so you might produce results that could surprise even you.

Children could prove a strong source of support and entertainment. Enjoy!",1,pisces,2018
18,"Today you're likely to be feeling especially fit and healthy and able to take on the most monumental of tasks, Pisces. Therefore, you could well decide to clean out the basement or tear all the weeds out of the backyard. Take care to pace yourself! These things need to be done, but not all at once. It's just as important for you to enjoy yourself as to spend the whole day working.",1,pisces,2018
19,"You could find the atmosphere today a bit oppressive, Pisces. The time has come to deal with some of the important questions you may have been avoiding for quite some time. It could be especially important to take a look at your life at home and see what you can do change the negative atmosphere that has come into your life over the past few weeks. Compromise can be a good thing, but not at the cost of your values and beliefs.",1,pisces,2018
20,"This is an ideal day to take a look at your financial situation, so get out your bank statements or dividend reports. Try and pretend that you're with your banker and describing your situation as objectively as possible, without overestimating what you bring in or underestimating what you spend. You won't regret this process, since it could prevent you from making some big mistakes later on.",1,pisces,2018
21,"A lot of physical and mental energy could be channeled today into artistic projects of some kind, Pisces. Your intuition is running rather high, so you might know instinctively what friends, lovers, and children are feeling before they tell you. You could also pick up a lot of their anxieties as well. You'll need to relax a little. Go for a workout and then attend a concert or sporting event. You deserve a little fun!",1,pisces,2018
22,"A warm and loving communication could come today from a longtime friend or romantic partner. This could be the high point of your day, Pisces, especially since a letter or delivery you've been waiting on for a while still might not come. An older relative or neighbor might come to your door wanting advice about something. Children could prove particularly inspiring at this time, as you're especially attuned to them now. Enjoy!",1,pisces,2018
23,"If you've been thinking about taking up the study of astrology, numerology, alchemy, or any other occult science, this is the day to get started, Pisces. Scientific adherence to facts and rules combines with enhanced telepathic abilities to bring about a burgeoning skill in such fields.

24,"You may be feeling a bit tired and worn out lately, Pisces. Don't push yourself to do things when you know that your body needs rest. It could be extremely tempting to roll with the crowd and participate in all the fun. You don't want to miss out on a single thing going on around you. Resist the temptation to disregard the important messages that are coming from your body. Slow down.",1,pisces,2018
25,"Your level of artistic inspiration is very high today, Pisces. Dreams or meditation may have brought up some spiritual insights and revelations for you, and you may have promptly forgotten them upon coming out of your dream or meditative state. This could prove very frustrating for you! Try writing them down even if you only remember snatches. This can actually bring them to the surface again. You'll want a record of them anyway.",1,pisces,2018
26,"Your imagination is flying high today, Pisces. Intellect and intuition join together in a vivid and explosive union where the whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts. Don't waste this energy. Get busy and work on whatever creative projects you're involved with, or start one if there aren't any. This energy may not come around again for a while and you'll want to make the most of it. Have fun!",1,pisces,2018
27,"Drink plenty of water in order to keep your system properly hydrated, Pisces. Water is the most important part of your diet, and it's likely that you aren't drinking nearly enough. You are highly sensitive today so taking care of yourself is the best thing you can do. Otherwise you might act emotional and too easily manipulated. Distance yourself from people who try to suck this life force from you.",1,pisces,2018
28,"Frustration and upset with others in your circle could tempt you to go out and get rid of that energy by spending a lot of money. You might overindulge in food or drink, or you could give in to impulse buying. Treat yourself a little, Pisces, but don't go overboard. You don't want to give yourself an upset stomach, and you won't want to take unwanted items back to the store. Instead, get some exercise or throw your passions into creative pursuits.",1,pisces,2018
29,"Attend a lecture or some sort of intellectual discussion in which people are actively expressing their ideas and strong opinions, Pisces. It's important for you to feel the passion of another who is incredibly focused on his or her dream.

30,"A lucky break could put you into a higher financial bracket than you were two days ago, Pisces. Career matters, perhaps those concerning the arts, could be involved in some way.

You'll want to feel absolutely fabulous tomorrow so you can continue to enjoy your success.",1,pisces,2018
31,"Dreams and meditation could lead to insights regarding how best to handle your finances and make your money grow, Pisces. You could receive some surprising ideas from newspapers, TV, or the Internet. Your level of intuition is very high. No matter how outrageous an idea may seem, consider it carefully before making a decision. A written plan of action for anything you do would be helpful. Too many ideas are popping into your head and you'll want to keep track of them.",1,pisces,2018
1,"Today is one of those days when you could feel lethargic and downbeat, Pisces. For some reason, even if you have a driving urge to get up and do something, it seems as if there’s a two-ton weight sitting right on top of your head. Meanwhile, everyone else is off and running. You’re probably better off this way. Learn from others’ mistakes when they land flat on their face. Gather information so you know best how to proceed on your own when the weight has lifted. It will happen soon.",2,pisces,2018
2,"People may seem especially insensitive to your feelings today, Pisces, but try not to get down on them about it. You may feel a sudden urge to act out in a physical manner, and you should do it, but in a constructive way. Get out of the house and take a walk or jog by a lake or river. Open your mind from the cage it’s been sitting in and get some perspective on your life.",2,pisces,2018
3,"Are you in love, Pisces? You might find that thoughts of your beloved haunt you today, even while you're apart. Desire and passion could be practically obsessive, and they'll interfere with your other projects if you aren't careful. Try to stay focused on the tasks at hand and make a date to get together with your partner later. After all, you want to keep all departments of your life in their proper perspective!",2,pisces,2018
4,"Try not to let today's blues get you down, Pisces. While it's true that some days can seem to drag on, the busier you are the faster time will pass. Get down to finishing any work still before you and then make plans for tonight. If there's a light at the end of the tunnel, not only will things seem to speed up but you'll feel better knowing it's coming.",2,pisces,2018
5,"Don't be surprised if you wake up feeling super today, Pisces. Chances are good that you'll feel a renewed physical strength with energy to spare. That said, it might be a good day to tackle any projects that require you to use some muscle. Perhaps there's some yard work that needs to be done or furniture you want to move around. On the fun side, you might want to get to the gym for a workout or swim. Whatever the activity, today is a good day to go for it!",2,pisces,2018
6,"You might feel cornered into doing something you just don't want to do today, Pisces. Perhaps you made a promise to handle a project, or someone close to you has decided that it's the day to tackle something specific. Either way, if you're uncomfortable following through, communicate that to this person. Your ability to express yourself and be understood is enhanced with this day's energy. Rescheduling might be far better than any potential resentment.",2,pisces,2018
7,"You might get an unexpected visit today, Pisces. And it's quite likely that it will be someone who really needs some comfort and support. Whether you have a huge list of things you want to get done or you were planning on just taking it easy, don't turn your friend away. Chores and hobbies will wait patiently for you, but lending care and support to someone in need often won't. Open your door and your heart if the situation arises.",2,pisces,2018
8,"It would be wise to spend some time thinking about your finances today, Pisces. Do you have a realistic budget, or does yours exclude such things as entertainment, gifts, and occasional splurges? Such a budget won't suffice, because these are expenses that everyone has. Take a good look at your spending habits and see where you could cut back without too much pain.",2,pisces,2018
9,"You're likely to be feeling pretty energetic today, Pisces, making it an opportune time to do some much-needed cleaning and organizing. Why not tackle those closets, attic, and storerooms? If you have to work, your desk, workspace, and filing cabinets could use a little attention. Just think how great it will feel when everything is in order! Make the most of your energy by accomplishing as much as you can.",2,pisces,2018
10,"Changes in your working environment could result in a rise in your income, Pisces. You've been working very hard in order to advance yourself in this regard, and you’re likely to continue to do so indefinitely. Your natural communication skills continue to serve you well, and your physical energy is likely to be stronger than it has been for a long time. The only downside is having very little time to yourself! Hang in there!",2,pisces,2018
11,"Although you may have been feeling somewhat out of sorts for the past few days, Pisces, today you could feel as if you just got a new lease on life. You’re in excellent physical, mental, and emotional shape, so you should be raring to go. Both immediate and long-term goals should be easy to achieve while your energy is strong today. Begin working on them; don't put them off. This high level of motivation should continue for a while.",2,pisces,2018
12,"News you may receive about your place of business or the people you work for might bring up some doubts about your future in this organization, Pisces. You might feel that you aren't getting anywhere. You might be considering the possibility of changing jobs or even careers. Someone may put forth a type of opportunity that you've never considered before. Think about it, but don't decide for a few days.",2,pisces,2018
13,"You’ll find that your mind is sharp and penetrating today, Pisces. Make sure you stay focused and organized. You have the power of discipline behind you that will help you manifest quite a bit on a day like today. Keep in mind that your openness to others and your incredible sensitivity are some of your greatest gifts. Use your power to create prosperity for yourself, but do it without hurting or manipulating others.",2,pisces,2018
14,"Some rather disturbing news about trends in the world economy could have you and everyone around you worrying about your financial future. Have faith, Pisces. What you're hearing may be total misinformation. The future is probably going to shape up to be far different than the picture you draw from the news. In fact, you might find that your own personal finances take a definite turn for the better.",2,pisces,2018
15,"Today your level of imagination and intuition is especially high, Pisces. Trust your heart today, especially where new projects and money are concerned. Insights may appear to knock at the doors of your conscious mind, yet it might take some deep thought to grasp their significance. Don't try to work it out through logic; it's best to let it all come to you. Then make use of logic to consider what you should do about it!",2,pisces,2018
16,"Insights that may come welling up from the past could be put to work for you in a positive way, Pisces. You could use them as inspiration for a creative project of some kind, or you could just make them work for you in your day-to-day dealings with others. You should be feeling especially romantic and sexy today, and you might want to go shopping for clothes made of soft, touchable fabrics. Relations with lovers should be close and passionate.",2,pisces,2018
17,"You might wake up this morning feeling a little less than your usual self, Pisces, and you might not be able to figure out why. There could be some sort of minor physical imbalance or you might be suffering from eyestrain.

Avoid computers, if possible, and take time during the day to run or go for a brisk walk.",2,pisces,2018
18,"Your intuition, imagination, and insight have served you well on the job, and should pay off soon. A raise, commission, or perhaps a chance to invest in the company could be offered to you. Your self-esteem will definitely receive a boost! You might also find that you’re growing even more intuitive than usual, and people are looking up to you because of it. Give yourself a pat on the back. You deserve it.",2,pisces,2018
19,"Worry about a family member may be on your mind today, Pisces. This person could be all wrought up over work, money, or possibly a love affair that's broken off. Say whatever reassuring words you can muster, but don't expect him or her to respond, and don't fall into the trap of feeling that your kind words were all in vain. They did register. It's just going to take this person a while to come to terms with the situation.",2,pisces,2018
20,"You’re intuitive by nature, Pisces, but today you’re likely to have a rush of psychic premonitions. Insights into your own character could bring old traumas to the surface so you can release them. Your dreams could be especially vivid and rather disconcerting, although not in a negative way. Write them down. Your aesthetic sense is also very high. Don't be surprised if you discover that you're rather partial to Impressionist art!",2,pisces,2018
21,"The fundraising activities of a group with which you're affiliated are going very well, Pisces, but today you're likely to find that things seem to be stalled. Checks may not come in the mail, important people don't return your phone calls, or someone doesn't show up to do the job at hand.

22,"There’s going to be so much to get done today that you might feel a little daunted about getting started. By midday you could even find yourself downright overwhelmed. Take a break, Pisces.

You may need to concentrate on finishing only one or two minor tasks today and put the rest off until tomorrow. Remember, too much stress can take its toll on your health!",2,pisces,2018
23,"You’re likely to receive a windfall of some sort today. Be cautious with it, Pisces. If you invest it wisely, it will serve you long and well. Your curiosity has been piqued about some rather esoteric subjects, perhaps the dark arts. Why not visit your local library to check out some books on these topics of interest?",2,pisces,2018
24,"None of your friends may be at home today, Pisces, and so you probably won't be able to have any phone conversations or visits with them. This could cause you to feel rather lonely. You might brood a little and convince yourself that no one cares about you any more. Snap out of it! You know full well this isn't the case. Read or watch videos until someone rings you up, and they will!",2,pisces,2018
25,"Your heart and intuition will rule today much more than your mind. Trust what your instincts tell you, Pisces. If you’re in a sales profession, you can expect the orders to come rolling in today, as your extrasensory perception helps you know your clients' needs almost before they do.

27,"There could be a missing person very much on your mind these days. Is it possible that the relationship is over and you're the last one to know?

He or she will seek out your warmth and friendship again soon.",2,pisces,2018
28,"Have you been entertaining the idea of changing jobs, Pisces? If so, put out some feelers today. You've been working hard and may have felt as if you've been barking up the wrong tree.

It's time to pass carefully from reflection to action.",2,pisces,2018
1,"Without a doubt, there's a lot of work to be done around the house. With today's planetary configuration, you feel especially vested in making your home look its best.

2,"A task that you've been working on for a long time could come to a standstill today due to circumstances beyond your control. You're likely to feel quite frustrated, Pisces, as there seems to be nothing you can do to speed things up. Don't agonize over this, however; it will get going again.

4,"A group with which you're affiliated could be excited about a course of action that you might not feel is wise now, Pisces. You might inform them of your reservations, but they're probably too charged up to listen. You could begin to have doubts about goals of your own that may be taking a long time to manifest. Hang in there. Sometimes things take longer than you'd like, but success is still in the wind.",3,pisces,2018
5,"Career and business continue to play a powerful role in your life now, as new ideas, new people, and considerations as mundane as modern equipment open up new doors for you, Pisces. In addition, romantic involvements could intensify. If you're currently committed to someone, expect to grow closer. If you're involved but not exclusive, a proposal could be on the horizon. If you aren't involved, don't be surprised if you meet someone new and exciting.",3,pisces,2018
6,"Your interest in certain off-the-wall topics may be encouraged when you're engaged in a conversation with someone who shares similar thoughts, Pisces. Perhaps you exchange ideas about UFOs and life on other planets. Suddenly you're looking at your life as if you were a character in a science-fiction novel. Exchange books and other literature with those of a similar mindset. You may not be the only one who thinks there is a conspiracy against them.",3,pisces,2018

8,"In all the time spent trying to stabilize your emotions and achieve sensitivity, you may get too caught up in your feelings, Pisces.

Take some time to listen to your thoughts and take them more seriously than you have been.",3,pisces,2018
9,"A renewed sense of physical vigor could have you plunging with determination into whatever projects you need to do today. However, your mind won't really be on them, Pisces, as you could be feeling especially passionate now.

Enjoy your day.",3,pisces,2018
10,"Your actions may be touched by a very fanciful frame of mind today, Pisces. Be careful about indulging in recreational substances that take you out of reality for a while. Your tendency will be to escape into the cosmos, but sooner or later you'll have to come down. Deal with your issues now before your thinking becomes even more clouded than before. Take action with a clear and sober mind.",3,pisces,2018
11,"Debates over philosophy, religion, and education are likely to turn into all-out war. Feel free to add your two cents, Pisces.

You'll feel much better if you can point to something and say that you created it.",3,pisces,2018

With these aspects, any new relationship or project begun today will have a wonderful energy behind it.",3,pisces,2018
15,"Today is good for entertaining, Pisces. Enjoy the company of family and friends, and don't get distracted by gloomy thoughts about work or money. Just relax and let others take care of themselves. You enjoy nurturing other people and making sure they have a wonderful time, but you need to have a great time as well, so don't work too hard. Someone may give you a gift, a token of love and appreciation.",3,pisces,2018
16,"Conflict between your responsibilities at home and career obligations, particularly those involving partners, could pose a problem today, Pisces. The problem isn't insurmountable, but does call for honest, open communication among all parties involved. You won't be happy at having to make a choice, and may find the two duties difficult to balance right now. Give it your best. By tomorrow things should be back to normal.",3,pisces,2018
17,"You could think that your life is too boring for anyone else to care about, Pisces. Don't fall into a well of self-pity and convince yourself that there simply isn't enough excitement in your life and never will be. Believe that you have the power to cure any such downtrodden feeling that you might have at this time. Consider joining a spiritual support group where you can honestly share your feelings.",3,pisces,2018
18,"Partnerships, possibly business related, are on the agenda, Pisces. You might find yourself in discussions dealing with such partnerships, as well as contracts and other paperwork. You might also set aside time during which you can concentrate on a romantic relationship, a new one or current one that's changing and growing. This is a good time to make decisions, as your mind is particularly focused now.",3,pisces,2018
19,"You may find that people aren't necessarily very sympathetic to your feelings today, Pisces. It's quite possible that they're more responsive to facts and information than emotions. It could be that you need to enlist some sort of translator in order to get through to a person with whom you're trying to communicate. Don't hesitate to ask for more clarification on something if you need it.",3,pisces,2018
20,"Plans for getting together with a group of close friends may have to be called off because of sudden unexpected events. This could have you feeling somewhat down, Pisces, especially if a romantic partner is involved. Try not to worry about it too much. You will be able to reschedule, and you could use the time alone anyway to relax and center yourself.",3,pisces,2018
21,"You've got a lot on your mind right now, Pisces, and others might be interpreting your quiet behavior as your being aloof. Go right ahead and let them think whatever they want. You've got some real issues to think through, and decisions with important consequences to come up with. You'll be able to smooth their ruffled feathers later. Right now, just focus on taking care of yourself.",3,pisces,2018
22,"Your natural sensitivity and compassion are given a powerful impetus today by strong feelings of love and affection for everyone around you, Pisces. Therefore, you're likely to give and receive a lot of expressions of affection, both overt and subtle. A significant other should feel especially romantic toward you, so relax and let him or her shower you with attention. Children could also prove a powerful source of support.",3,pisces,2018
23,"Business-oriented social events could take up a lot of your time today, Pisces. You could either be planning or attending them. If the latter, however, it could well be more than one. You're feeling especially outgoing at this time, so you should make a good impression and possibly even make a few new friends. However, it's also important to remember to take some time for yourself.",3,pisces,2018
24,"Some rather extensive and annoying paperwork might need to be dealt with, Pisces. It will probably require all your attention, so if you can, take care of it first thing in the morning when you're still fresh. This might be a contract or it could be an insurance policy or something else full of unintelligible jargon. Don't be afraid to ask someone familiar with it to explain the language to you.",3,pisces,2018
25,"Phone calls and emails between you and your friends may get misplaced or otherwise go astray, Pisces. A little patience is called for when trying to reach anyone at this time, especially if modern technology is involved. If a matter is urgent, it might be best to do the old-fashioned thing and actually go see the person in question. That's the only way to ensure reaching anyone right now.",3,pisces,2018
26,"Work on projects that require imagination and sensitivity could well take up a lot of your time today, Pisces. Some in-depth research may be involved. The work might require a lot of energy and concentration, perhaps more than you expected, but you should be more than satisfied with the results in the end. Just make sure to take breaks, and don't forget to eat. You'll need the fuel, after all!",3,pisces,2018
27,"You've been extremely busy these past few months, working extra hours at the office, then going out with friends late at night. This sort of behavior is known as ""burning the candle at both ends,"" and it rarely has a happy ending, Pisces. You need to take some quiet time, ideally with someone special. It's likely that your romantic partner misses you and would jump at the opportunity to spend an intimate evening with you.",3,pisces,2018
28,"You could have some strange, mystical dreams tonight, Pisces, possibly involving angels or other spiritual beings. Their messages could well shed light on a romantic relationship that you might not understand well. Keep a notebook by your bed so you can write down the details of the dreams as soon as you awaken. You'll want to consider them very carefully to see if you can figure out what's going on.",3,pisces,2018
29,"Relationships of all kinds become stronger and more enduring today, Pisces. Successes boost the strength of business partnerships; love relationships advance to the next level of commitment.

Write them down as soon as you can. You'll be glad you did.",3,pisces,2018
31,"Someone you know from work could suddenly seem to have romantic feelings for you, Pisces. At first this might make you a little uncomfortable, since you've never thought of this person in that way before. Don't do anything rash. Think about it first. Maybe there's potential, maybe not, but don't jump at it or dismiss it out of hand. Who knows? This person could prove to be your ideal mate!",3,pisces,2018
1,"You probably won't feel like working today, Pisces. You may not be tired, but you're probably bored, restless, and unable to focus. It's best to concentrate on routines or mundane chores you can do automatically on days like this. Put on your headphones. Take a long, leisurely lunch or perhaps brunch with friends. It's important to have some fun. Think of it as an exercise to balance your usually serious self!",4,pisces,2018
2,"Your sensitive nature is likely to pick up a disturbance in your thinking today, Pisces. Suddenly, a blast of unexpected information could come your way and throw a monkey wrench in your mental process. Try not to get thrown off balance by the sudden jolt. You'll find that you can incorporate some of this new knowledge in a way that gives you a greater advantage.",4,pisces,2018
3,"You could lapse into pessimism, Pisces. Suddenly the glass appears half empty and everything looks bleak. You feel like you're going around in circles. You might ask yourself what you're doing it all for anyway. You can talk yourself out of this mood as easily as you talked yourself into it. It might not seem possible, but you must trust that it's necessary in order to see the glass as half full again.",4,pisces,2018
4,"One whiff of a familiar scent is likely to send your imagination running wild, Pisces. Perhaps you're suddenly transported back to when you were dating someone you adored. Once your imagination starts running, it could be difficult to slow it down. Your fantasy world is likely to be the safest place to hide, so don't worry about avoiding reality. Keep playing in the past if that's where you'd rather be today.",4,pisces,2018
5,"There is a lot on your mind today, Pisces. Over the last three weeks you've analyzed your relationships on a deep and profound level. New people with attractive qualities could be tempting you to make a change. But is this a good time in your life to start up friendships or love relationships? Are you willing to accept the upheaval such changes would create? These are worthwhile questions to ask.",4,pisces,2018
6,"These past three weeks were rather good for your equilibrium, Pisces. It was just a matter of getting a bit more involved in life than is usual for you, and showing what you're capable of. It's likely you had a mixture of successes and setbacks, but on the whole, improvements have been steady. You might have noticed that something about you needed improvement, but isn't that true for everyone?",4,pisces,2018
7,"An unexpected financial setback could have you reeling at first, Pisces. Perhaps an emergency, such as a toothache or car breakdown, requires a substantial expenditure that you hadn't planned for. You can probably find a way to deal with the crisis. You may have resources to draw upon that you aren't aware of now. Go over all your finances and you could be pleasantly surprised. Hang in there!",4,pisces,2018
8,"Today you and the other members of your household might discuss the possibility of making some changes, Pisces. This could involve some redecorating or remodeling or even something as mundane as a thorough cleaning. However, it could also involve the possibility of moving to a completely different place. The need for change in your surroundings is apparent, so don't hesitate. Go ahead and initiate the first steps!",4,pisces,2018
9,"You might want to spend most of today outside, Pisces, perhaps taking a walk through a park. You could have some serious thinking to do and feel the best recourse is to be by yourself for a while. Decisions won't come easily today, so don't try to force them. Just enjoy being out in the fresh air. Sometimes things come together more quickly if you forget about them for a while.",4,pisces,2018
10,"Usually you enjoy talking with others, Pisces, but today you won't even want to answer the phone. Your physical stamina and mental energy are low, and you could feel out of sorts. It might help if you go for a walk sometime in the afternoon. You won't want to waste your evening lying around the house. Get the endorphins going and then go to a movie. You'll soon be your old self again!",4,pisces,2018
11,"Communication between you and either a business or romantic partner should get a fresh start today, Pisces. You've gotten to know each other better and feel more comfortable being honest and open with each other than before. All signs are that any partnerships begun, renewed, or confirmed today are likely to be successful and profitable. Bear this in mind in future months when you hit the rough spots!",4,pisces,2018
12,"Some vivid, inspiring, and intense dreams or visions could come your way today, Pisces. They could involve paranormal figures, such as angels. Make sure you keep a record of them, as your higher self is trying to tell you something. Make a list of all the images you can remember and analyze what these images symbolize to you. You could come up with some profound insights about the world and yourself.",4,pisces,2018
13,"A particularly tricky situation could occur at work. If you aren't careful, you could lose your cool. Make a concerted effort to keep your wits about you, Pisces. It could be that a colleague is baiting you, but that's no reason to take it. Keep to yourself as much as possible today. Close your office door. At home, go to bed early. Relax with a good book. All will be calmer tomorrow.",4,pisces,2018
14,"Love and romance are definitely on the agenda for today, Pisces, and you should be feeling warm, passionate, and particularly sexy. You're likely to be looking quite attractive, too, and romantic partners or potential partners could seem especially attractive to you. This is a wonderful day to shop for new clothes, have your hair styled, or prepare a candlelit dinner for someone very special. Go for it!",4,pisces,2018
15,"Technology is going to play a big role in your life today and in the immediate future, Pisces. It could be that your office is upgrading its systems and you're in charge of getting everyone up to speed on the new equipment. Or it's possible that you'll decide to take a class to increase your technical knowledge. One thing is clear - you're likely to achieve extraordinary success through the use of technology.",4,pisces,2018
16,"You might find yourself wrestling some ongoing, unresolved issues that could interfere with your ability to do your job. Be mindful that you're a bit brittle today, particularly if you're working on financial matters, Pisces. The last thing you want is a major battle with those around you, so do your best to keep a cool head. Don't let uncontrolled emotions rule the day.",4,pisces,2018
17,"Don't take anything you read or hear today at face value, Pisces. It's possible that you'll receive some rather distressing news, but before you react in frustration, read the fine print.

18,"All financial undertakings have good aspects today, Pisces. It could be that you have been thinking of starting a new business venture. If so, you're likely to meet the ideal business partner. Keep your eyes and ears tuned as you go about your daily routine. You never know when you might be introduced to that one special person you need in your life. Socialize in the evening with good friends.",4,pisces,2018
19,"Today you could feel overwhelmed with obligations and commitments to others. There isn't a moment free for yourself, not even for a bathroom break! Clearly, something's out of balance, Pisces. It's time to take charge of your life. It's wonderful that you have such a giving, generous spirit, but you do no one any favors if you burn out from exhaustion. Take some time to refill the well of your soul.",4,pisces,2018
20,"Take advantage of the lighthearted, flighty feeling of the day instead of getting annoyed by it, Pisces. You can't hide in your bedroom forever. Well, you could, but you'd end up wasting away and no one would even notice. This is a good day to get out and have fun with friends. Make wishes for people instead of cursing them. Make connections. Remember to laugh as often as possible.",4,pisces,2018
21,"Staying in touch with a love partner could be difficult today, Pisces, almost to the point of causing a minor panic. Don't jump to any unwarranted conclusions about possible problems in the relationship. What's causing the silence is probably beyond your friend's control, and could well be related to sudden and unexpected crises, or possibly something as mundane as a computer breakdown. Be patient and hang in there.",4,pisces,2018
22,"You tend to be intuitive by nature, Pisces, but today you could receive psychic impressions by the dozen. You might even experience visions or hear voices. Don't worry – you aren't going crazy! You do, however, need to pay attention to these messages. They may have immense personal or even planetary significance. If you can't make sense of them, write them down. It should all be clear to you later.",4,pisces,2018
23,"A sum of money that you might have been expecting from far away may be delayed, Pisces. This could be frustrating for you, but don't panic. The money is indeed coming. So unless your situation is urgent, just sit back and wait. If you want to check with those who are sending it, by all means do so. However, you'll probably find that the matter is out of their hands. Be patient and hang in there.",4,pisces,2018
24,"This would be a good day to stay home and spend much of the day in bed, Pisces! You've been working especially hard lately, juggling both home and work with your usual aplomb. But today you could feel a bit worn out and overwhelmed by everything that remains to be done. Give yourself a day of rest. Spend the day with a good book or some movies. You'll find this solitary time refreshing.",4,pisces,2018
25,"Sometimes it's easier to tend to life's mundane details rather than lift your eyes and see the big picture, Pisces. For example, it's likely that you've grown complacent at work. Could it be that you aren't at the right job or in the right career after all? Busying yourself with trivia isn't the way to avoid answering the question. It's imperative that you face it head on and make the necessary changes.",4,pisces,2018
26,"Throughout the day you may get the feeling that something has changed in the way people relate to each other, Pisces. It will be as if people are surer of themselves, more open, more expressive. Where, exactly, do you fit into all of this? Are you in a mood to charm other people just for fun? This period is perfect for taking care of your appearance and getting in shape. Do it!",4,pisces,2018
27,"You could be feeling playful today, Pisces. Your romantic partner will certainly appreciate your fun-loving mood. Why not plan a fun day together doing something other than your usual routine?

Your relationship will benefit from an injection of spontaneity.",4,pisces,2018
28,"Today doubts, uncertainties, and insecurities could plague a love relationship, Pisces. Does your beloved share your passion? Is your friend being honest and open with you?

Only in this way will your doubts be resolved one way or the other.",4,pisces,2018
29,"Today you might find yourself hosting an impromptu social event, Pisces, and more people could show up than you initially counted on. Don't worry about it, however. The party should be enjoyable for everyone even if the place is a bit crowded. Your visitors can look out for themselves. Among the unexpected guests might be an attractive, interesting person who could shape up to be a potential love partner. Relax and enjoy your day.",4,pisces,2018
30,"Paperwork involving money could be a real drag for you today, Pisces. You'll have to get it done, but you'd rather be elsewhere. It might also seem a little confusing. If you get to it early and concentrate, you should finish it quickly and then get on to what you want to do. After a morning of intense, tedious work, you'll probably be ready for some entertainment like a movie or sports event. Have fun!",4,pisces,2018
1,"It might seem like you no longer completely believe in what you're doing, Pisces, perhaps because you've been going a little too quickly in your quest to get what you need. It's very possible that your social life has slowed down a lot now - just when you decided to go full speed in this domain. Surprising what the astral energy can do, isn't it? Don't get upset. You can't do a thing about it.",5,pisces,2018
2,"You don't have to create everything alone, Pisces. Life isn't an individual sport. To live life fully, you must participate. Often this involves interacting with other people. This is an exercise in confidence. Do you want to be with us - yes or no? Regardless of your answer, outside events will lead you in a direction that you can neither predict nor imagine.",5,pisces,2018
3,"Your concept of reality could be based more on your emotions than facts, Pisces. This is one of those days when this could get you into trouble. Whatever comes up, you're likely to feel very passionate about it and tend to lose any rational perspective whatsoever. Integrity, inner strength, and self-confidence will be the glue that holds your mind and heart together.",5,pisces,2018
4,"The planets want to make a deal with you today, Pisces. Either you stay in bed fantasizing about life as a CEO or rock star or you get up, get dressed, and do what you have to do to make your dreams come true. Try and convince yourself once and for all that you don't have to lose your childlike wonder when you enter the real world. That never goes away, no matter how old you get!",5,pisces,2018
5,"A friend might be feeling a little depressed today and need some cheering up. Social events or group activities could be of great help in doing that, and it would do you some good as well, Pisces.

6,"The opportunity to travel, perhaps with friends or a group you belong to, could come your way today, Pisces. Discussions with others could lead to the confirmation of practical arrangements. You might also seek to advance your education, as your intellect is especially active now. Whatever new experiences come your way could lead to new paths, interests, and opportunities. Don't let doubts or fears get in your way.",5,pisces,2018
7,"Things could be moving more quickly than makes you comfortable right now, Pisces. You may feel as if your own needs and agenda are getting lost in the fury bubbling around you.

Use the lightning-quick energy at hand to mobilize your efforts.",5,pisces,2018
8,"Love is very real to you. You're apt to take it very seriously, perhaps even too seriously, Pisces. This is one of those emotions that eventually takes over your brain and leaves no room for rational thoughts on the topic. The good news is that matters regarding love and romance should be stabilizing at this time, giving you the opportunity to face this area of your life from a rational perspective.",5,pisces,2018
9,"It's going to be a little difficult talking to you today, Pisces. You, who can be easily influenced by others, will be listening to and criticizing everything that people say. Nothing emotional or vague is going to get into your head. It's as if you've installed an extremely fine filter that lets in only what you allow. You're going to appear to be a real expert. Don't show off too much!",5,pisces,2018
10,"Today is a good day to organize professional or personal meetings. They will be productive. It's an auspicious time for efficient, serious communication, realistic plans, and group harmony. All the ingredients for success and true advancement are available. Don't be surprised if you're the one in charge. You're especially good at creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere.",5,pisces,2018
11,"Today you could feel a little more vulnerable than usual, Pisces. Perhaps you feel hemmed in by decisions you can't put off any longer. Or you could be a little overworked and overwhelmed by all your activities. If only your children could be a little more independent! The day ahead will help you make some decisive progress. No backward glances allowed! Dwelling on the past won't help you at all.",5,pisces,2018
12,"If by chance you still harbor some resentment toward someone, Pisces, it will probably come out today. You might be uncompromising or even vengeful. Telling that person how you feel will accomplish nothing other than cause you both pain and regret. Vent your anger in a healthy way, such as some form of intense physical activity. Besides, this person really means what they've been saying. That's right, they do care about you.",5,pisces,2018
13,"An opportunity to travel with a partner or colleague could come your way, perhaps for business. Any travel planned or begun today is likely to go well and bring you whatever results you hope for.

The first step is to figure out how you can make a living from it. Welcome back to reality!",5,pisces,2018
15,"You might want to check your alarm clock to be sure it really woke you up this morning, Pisces. Your tendency will be to stay in the cocoon of your own little dream world, deep in your own thoughts. Obsessive thoughts, in particular, will try and drown out some more pressing issues from the past that really need to be dealt with once and for all. ""Ring, ring!"" It's time to wake up!",5,pisces,2018
16,"These last few weeks have been good for your equilibrium, Pisces. It was a question of becoming a bit more involved in life than usual, and showing what you're capable of.

You may have noticed that this or that about yourself needs improvement, but isn't that true for everyone?",5,pisces,2018
17,"Your head is filled with passion today, Pisces, and you may be feeling a bit more sentimental than usual. The one difficulty with this is that there may not be an appropriate situation in which to express this emotion as fully as you might like. Try to navigate the waters toward a safe place where the people around you support you. Avoid those who might want to pop your bubble.",5,pisces,2018
18,"If you've always felt the desire to write, now is the time to take the plunge, Pisces. You certainly don't lack the imagination! Your problem may be that you have difficulty taking your prose seriously. Don't think about being “A Writer.” Just write! And above all, don't hesitate to let people read what you write. A writer's group would be a great way for you to come out of hiding.",5,pisces,2018
19,"With today's celestial energy, you're going to feel like you're on vacation, Pisces. This planetary configuration often gives people the feeling of having a fresh mind and calm disposition.

Be careful that you aren't hurting someone just because you know that they'll forgive you.",5,pisces,2018
21,"You should be able to put on your famous smile this morning and keep it on all day, Pisces. Advertise your beautiful soul to the world. If other people are sad, it's fine to sympathize, but don't bear their ailments for them. Keep up a bit of a shield to protect yourself from this energy. At the same time, you want to keep a window open so other people can see you from the inside.",5,pisces,2018
22,"You may feel that you've made real progress in your relationships, Pisces. And you're right to feel this way. ""Evolution"" best defines the path you're on right now. You can be proud of yourself, because the work you do on an individual level is the best way for you to contribute to the development of society. This way of taking action is no less important than the work done by global organizations.",5,pisces,2018
23,"Your actions today could take an investigative approach, Pisces. You're able to probe much more deeply than usual as you search people's eyes for the answers you seek.

People may come to you for advice, and you're in the perfect position to give it.",5,pisces,2018
24,"You may feel a bit of strain today as you try to figure out the best way to get to where you need to be, Pisces. On the one hand, the happy approach calls for you to let loose, be courageous, and strike out with conviction toward the things that mean the most to you.

Problems that once seemed insurmountable now resolve themselves almost without your help. Lucky you!",5,pisces,2018
26,"You might find that words aren't the best way to communicate today, Pisces. Body language and the sense of touch and taste are much more effective. You'll find that your senses will be heightened overall. The smell of the restaurant several blocks away could make your taste buds water. Give in to your senses and let your feet follow your nose. Go enjoy a good meal tonight with someone special.",5,pisces,2018
27,"It could be that you've been losing faith in your dreams and fantasies lately, Pisces. Now is the time to refocus on what you want and move forward with confidence.

Today's shift may be subtle, but it should indicate smooth sailing for the next few weeks.",5,pisces,2018
28,"Things should go especially well for you today, Pisces, so don't worry about a thing. Life doesn't necessarily get easier as you get older. You just learn how to deal with things.

You realize that things are much better than you may have thought.",5,pisces,2018

Starting today, Pisces, you're going to be asked to be more concrete.",5,pisces,2018
30,"The masculine and feminine sides of your personality should be working together well today, Pisces. The key is to keep the energy moving. Try not to stagnate on any one issue. Use your words and nurturing abilities to soothe others' worries. Actively direct your energy outward with the tender sensitivity that you possess within. Your inner strength is one of your most valuable resources.",5,pisces,2018
31,"Come out of your shell today, Pisces. You'll notice that people are much more sensitive to your feelings because they seem to be more emotional themselves.

Let others know that you're listening to them.",5,pisces,2018
1,"You may get the feeling that you're rubbing against sandpaper today, Pisces. More than likely, this is a result of issues deep inside you.
